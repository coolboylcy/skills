# Adaptive Question Bank

Ask only 4-6 questions per onboarding run.

## Identity and matching
- Which field should be the primary account key: Salesforce Id, domain, or another custom field?
- If both `Website` and custom domain fields exist, which one is source of truth?

## Pipeline priorities
- Should recommendations prioritize net-new pipeline, expansion, or churn prevention?
- Should open opportunities suppress prospecting suggestions for the same account?

## Engagement weighting
- How heavily should recency be weighted for activities and emails?
- Should campaign engagement include both Contacts and Leads by default?

## Signal systems
- I detected probable 6sense fields. Should these drive prioritization?
- Any managed-package fields to explicitly include or ignore?

## Data safety
- Are there fields to exclude from output by default (PII/sensitive)?
