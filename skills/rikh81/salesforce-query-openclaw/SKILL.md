# Salesforce Query (Schema-Adaptive)

Most Salesforce scripts work in one org, then break in the next. This skill was built to fix that.

It discovers your schema first, then runs reusable GTM workflows against what actually exists in your environment.

## Source code

- GitHub: https://github.com/RikH81/salesforce-query-openclaw-skill

## Security model

- Credentials are stored in macOS Keychain (`openclaw.salesforce`)
- No plaintext credential-file fallback
- Supports session-only mode via `--no-save`
- Restricts `SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL` to HTTPS Salesforce domains

## 1) Configure credentials

Required variables:
- `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID`
- `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL`

Preferred flow:
1. Create a Salesforce Connected App and dedicated least-privilege integration user.
2. Store secrets in a secure secret manager if possible.
3. Default persistence is macOS Keychain. Plaintext credential-file fallback has been removed.

Credentials can be persisted locally via:

```python
from salesforce_client import save_credentials, check_credentials

ok, missing = check_credentials()
if not ok:
    save_credentials(client_id="...", client_secret="...", instance_url="...")
```

## 2) Run onboarding discovery

Run an end-to-end discovery pass:

```bash
python3 scripts/onboarding.py
```

For session-only credentials (nothing persisted):

```bash
python3 scripts/onboarding.py --no-save
```

If credentials are missing, onboarding prompts for them and saves them before continuing.

If credentials are not ready, run quick setup guidance mode:

```bash
python3 scripts/onboarding.py --guided
```

You can also type `help` at the first credential prompt to show setup guidance inline.

If Python dependency `requests` is missing, onboarding will stop and print explicit setup commands for a local `.venv-salesforce`.

Run a credential safety check any time:

```bash
python3 scripts/credential_doctor.py
```

For automation or CI, pass credentials directly:

```bash
python3 scripts/onboarding.py \
  --client-id "$SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID" \
  --client-secret "$SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --instance-url "$SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL" \
  --non-interactive
```

Session-only credentials (no disk persistence):

```bash
python3 scripts/onboarding.py \
  --client-id "$SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID" \
  --client-secret "$SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --instance-url "$SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL" \
  --non-interactive --no-save
```

Optional custom output path:

```bash
python3 scripts/onboarding.py --out ~/.config/openclaw/salesforce_profile.json
```

This will:
1. Validate auth.
2. Discover accessible objects.
3. Describe fields on core GTM objects.
4. Detect optional signal packs (intent, revenue, risk, engagement).
5. Generate targeted follow-up questions.
6. Save a reusable profile JSON.

## 3) Ask adaptive follow-ups

Use generated questions from onboarding output, then persist answers in the profile.

Reference question bank:
- `references/question-bank.md`

## 4) Build and use mapping profile

Use `assets/profile-template.json` as the canonical profile format.

Keep uncertain mappings marked as low confidence until user confirms.

## 5) Query patterns

For ready-to-use workflows, use:

```bash
python3 scripts/starter_workflows.py
```

or import functions from `scripts/starter_workflows.py`:
- `top_accounts_to_work_today(...)`
- `pipeline_rescue_board(...)`
- `campaign_followup_opportunities(...)`

Each returns a structured payload with `summary`, `rows`, and `next_best_action` to proactively guide users.

Use `salesforce_client.py` for regular querying:

```python
from salesforce_client import SalesforceClient

sf = SalesforceClient()
accounts = sf.get_account_by_name("Acme")
opps = sf.get_open_opportunities()
```

For schema discovery:

```python
from salesforce_client import SalesforceClient
from schema_discovery import SchemaDiscovery

sf = SalesforceClient()
discovery = SchemaDiscovery(sf)
schema = discovery.discover()
```
