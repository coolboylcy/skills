# iammeter Skill (Node.js)

A Node.js client and CLI for the iammeter API, based on the official swagger spec.

Features
- API key is loaded automatically: first from the `IAMMETER_TOKEN` environment variable,
  then from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (`skills.entries.iammeter.apiKey`)
- List user sites (sitelist)
- Get latest data for all meters (metersdata)
- Get latest upload data for a single meter (meterdata / meterdata2)
- Query site energy history (energyhistory) and export CSV
- Power analysis (poweranalysis), offline analysis (offlineanalysis)

Configuration
- Option A (OpenClaw / Clawhub): set the API key in the Skills UI. It is stored in
  `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `skills.entries.iammeter.apiKey` and injected
  as the `IAMMETER_TOKEN` environment variable at runtime.
- Option B (local testing): export IAMMETER_TOKEN=<your_api_key> before running.
