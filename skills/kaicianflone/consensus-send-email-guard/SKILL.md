# consensus-send-email-guard

`consensus-send-email-guard` is a production-style outbound communication guardrail.

## What this skill does

- evaluates an email draft with a persona panel
- aggregates votes by reputation (weighted approval policy)
- enforces hard-block categories (sensitive data, legal/medical certainty, disallowed guarantees)
- returns final decision: `APPROVE | BLOCK | REWRITE`
- writes `decision` and updated `persona_set` artifacts to board state

## Why this matters

Email is high-impact and irreversible once sent. This skill reduces hallucinated promises and policy-violating claims before external side effects occur.

## Ecosystem role

Stack position:

`consensus-tools -> consensus-interact pattern -> persona_set -> send-email-guard`

It converts raw generation into governed action with auditability.

## Governance and learning

- strict JSON contracts for automation pipelines
- idempotent retries to prevent duplicate reputation mutation
- reputation updates calibrate evaluator influence over time

## Use cases

- customer-facing outbound messaging
- partner/legal-sensitive communications
- automated campaign quality gates


## Runtime, credentials, and network behavior

- runtime binaries: `node`, `tsx`
- network calls: none in the guard decision path itself
- conditional network behavior: if a run needs persona generation and your persona-generator backend uses an external LLM, that backend may perform outbound API calls
- credentials: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or equivalent provider key) may be required **only** for persona generation in LLM-backed setups; if `persona_set_id` is provided, guards can run without LLM credentials
- filesystem writes: board/state artifacts under the configured consensus state path

## Dependency trust model

- `consensus-guard-core` and `consensus-persona-generator` are first-party consensus packages
- versions are semver-pinned in `package.json` for reproducible installs
- this skill does not request host-wide privileges and does not mutate other skills

## Quick start

```bash
node --import tsx run.js --input ./examples/email-input.json
```

## Tool-call integration

This skill is wired to the consensus-interact contract boundary (via shared consensus-guard-core wrappers where applicable):
- readBoardPolicy
- getLatestPersonaSet / getPersonaSet
- writeArtifact / writeDecision
- idempotent decision lookup

This keeps board orchestration standardized across skills.

## Invoke Contract

This skill exposes a canonical entrypoint:

- `invoke(input, opts?) -> Promise<OutputJson | ErrorJson>`

`invoke()` starts the guard flow, which then executes persona evaluation and consensus-interact-contract board operations (via shared guard-core wrappers where applicable).

## external_agent mode

Guards support two modes:
- `mode="persona"` (default): guard loads/generates persona_set and runs internal persona voting.
- `mode="external_agent"`: caller supplies `external_votes[]` from real agents; guard performs deterministic aggregation, policy checks, and board decision writes without requiring persona harness.
