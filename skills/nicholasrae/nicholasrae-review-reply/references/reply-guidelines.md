## Brand Identity

**Talos Inc.** builds apps for real people who care about their experiences — aviation enthusiasts (FeedFare), personal growth seekers (Inflection Point), and pet lovers (PetFace). Our voice reflects who we are: a small indie team that genuinely cares.

### Voice Pillars

| Pillar | What It Means | What It Sounds Like |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Warm** | Human first, not corporate | "We're so sorry to hear that" not "We apologize for the inconvenience" |
| **Genuine** | Real people, real care | No copy-paste phrases, no scripts |
| **Brief** | Respect their time | 2–4 sentences max |
| **Accountable** | Own mistakes | "That's on us" not "Due to technical circumstances" |
| **Hopeful** | Leave them with a path forward | Every reply ends with a next step or genuine well-wish |

## Tone by Star Rating

### 1★ — Frustrated or Broken

The user is at peak frustration. They may have lost data, hit a blocker, or feel let down.

**Tone:** Empathetic, humble, immediately useful  
**Goal:** De-escalate, acknowledge, give a concrete path forward

✅ DO:
- Lead with empathy — feel the frustration before explaining anything
- Acknowledge the specific issue they mentioned (don't be vague)
- If there's a known fix, state it clearly in one sentence
- Invite them to reach out directly (support email)
- Thank them for the time it took to leave a review

❌ DON'T:
- Start with "Thank you for your feedback" — it sounds automated
- Be defensive ("Our app works fine for most users…")
- Make promises you can't keep ("We'll fix this right away!")
- Ask them to update if no update exists
- Use "We value your feedback" — ever

**Example 1★ reply:**
> "We're genuinely sorry — that sounds like a terrible experience and definitely not how FeedFare should work. We've seen this with certain feed configurations and our team has a fix in review. If you're willing, DM us at support@feedfare.app and we'll get you sorted immediately. 🙏"

---

### 2★ — Disappointed, Not Broken

The app works but failed expectations. Common: missing features, confusing UX, performance issues.

**Tone:** Empathetic + informative  
**Goal:** Address the gap, show you've heard them, offer what exists

✅ DO:
- Validate their expectation ("That's a completely fair point")
- Explain what exists if they missed a feature
- If the feature is on the roadmap, hint at it (but don't over-commit)
- Invite feedback — these users want to help you improve
- Be honest if something is a known limitation

❌ DON'T:
- Sound defensive or dismissive
- Over-promise features or timelines
- Write more than 4 sentences

**Example 2★ reply:**
> "Totally understand the frustration — that workflow feels clunkier than it should. You can actually do this from the top-right menu (we know it's not obvious and we're working on surfacing it better). Happy to walk you through it if you reach out at support@feedfare.app. Thanks for the honest feedback — it helps!"

---

### 3★ — Mixed, Sees Potential

The user likes something but something else is holding them back from loving it. These are your most valuable reviews.

**Tone:** Grateful + engaged + specific  
**Goal:** Show you heard the nuance, address the pain, build relationship

✅ DO:
- Acknowledge what they liked and what they didn't, separately
- Be specific — they took the time to be nuanced, match that
- Give them a path to see the improvement (version update, setting, workaround)
- These users are convertible to 5★ if you genuinely engage

❌ DON'T:
- Write a wall of text
- Gloss over the negative part
- Be sycophantic about the positive part

**Example 3★ reply:**
> "Really appreciate the thoughtful review — glad the feed curation is clicking for you. The notification timing is something we hear about often and it's next on our list (v2.2 due soon). If you want early access to test it, just drop us a line at support@feedfare.app. 🙌"

---

## Phrases to Use ✅

These feel natural and human:

- "We're sorry to hear that…"
- "That's definitely not the experience we want for you"
- "Totally fair point"
- "We hear you on this"
- "That's on us"
- "This is actually something we're actively working on"
- "Happy to help sort this out"
- "Thanks for taking the time to write this"
- "We'd love to help — reach out at [email]"
- "Really appreciate the honest feedback"

---

## Phrases to NEVER Use ❌

These sound corporate, automated, or hollow:

- ~~"Thank you for your feedback"~~ (opening)
- ~~"We value your feedback"~~
- ~~"We apologize for any inconvenience"~~
- ~~"We are continuously working to improve"~~
- ~~"We take your concerns seriously"~~
- ~~"Due to technical circumstances"~~
- ~~"Please reach out to our customer support team"~~ (too cold)
- ~~"We hope this resolves your issue"~~
- ~~"- The [App] Team"~~ (signature — App Store shows developer name)

---

## Structural Rules

### Length
- **Maximum:** 4 sentences
- **Sweet spot:** 2–3 sentences
- App Store replies are read on mobile — keep them scannable

### Opening
- Never start with "Thank you" or "Hi [name]"
- Start with empathy for negative reviews: "We're sorry…", "That's completely fair…"
- Start with appreciation for mixed: "Really appreciate the nuance here…"

### Closing
- Always end with a forward-looking element:
  - A next step ("reach out at [email]")
  - A soft promise ("working on it for the next release")
  - A warm wish ("Hope we can win you back!")
- Emoji are fine — use sparingly (1 max per reply, usually at the end)

### Signature
- Do NOT add "- The FeedFare Team" or similar
- App Store automatically displays the developer name

---

## App-Specific Notes

### FeedFare
- Support email: `support@feedfare.app`
- Key differentiator: personalized aviation news feed, offline reading
- Common complaints to address proactively:
  - Feed not refreshing → "Try a pull-to-refresh and ensure background refresh is on in Settings"
  - Missing sources → "You can add custom RSS feeds in Settings → Sources"
  - Widget not updating → "Known iOS limitation — our workaround is in v2.1.x"

### Inflection Point
- Support email: TBD
- Key differentiator: reflection + journaling for personal growth
- Tone: slightly more introspective, mindful

### PetFace
- Support email: TBD
- Tone: playful, warm, light — pet content is inherently joyful
- Even 1★ replies can have a slightly lighter touch

---

## Escalation (Do Not Reply)

Some reviews should NOT receive a reply. Flag for Nick's review:

- **Legal threats** ("I'm suing you", "contact my lawyer")
- **Abusive content** (harassment, slurs)
- **Spam/competitor attacks** (clearly fake reviews)
- **Sensitive personal disclosures** (mental health crises, etc.)

For these: mark as `rejected` in the queue with a note.

## When to Reply vs. Skip

| Review Type | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 1★ — genuine complaint | Always reply |
| 2★ — genuine complaint | Always reply |
| 3★ — mixed | Reply (high conversion potential) |
| 4★ — positive with a note | Optional (reply if they mention a specific issue) |
| 5★ — pure praise | Skip (no reply needed; saves API calls) |
| 1★ — clearly spam/fake | Skip |
| Any — legal threat | Skip (flag for Nick) |

1. **Would I be proud if this was screenshotted and shared?** → Must be yes

4. **Does it use any of the forbidden phrases?** → Must be no
