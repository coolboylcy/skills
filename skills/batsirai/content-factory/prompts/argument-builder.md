**Length:** {word_count} words
**Audience:** {audience}

Build a persuasive essay using this structure:

## 1. HOOK (5%)
Start with a surprising statistic, specific story, or question that makes the thesis feel inevitable.

## 2. PROBLEM (15%)
Establish what's broken and why it matters. Include real costs and consequences. Make the reader feel the ache.

## 3. CURRENT SOLUTIONS (15%)
Explain why existing approaches fail. Be fair but critical. Show you understand what people have tried.

## 4. THESIS (5%)
Present your argument clearly in one sentence. No hedging.

## 5. EVIDENCE (35%)
Provide 3-5 supporting points, each with:
- Data or research citations
- Expert opinions or authority
- Real-world examples (specific, not generic)
- Logical reasoning that connects to the reader's experience

## 6. COUNTERARGUMENTS (10%)
Address the 2 strongest objections head-on. Don't strawman. Steel-man the opposition, then respond.

## 7. IMPLICATIONS (10%)
What changes if you're right? Paint the picture of the world where this thesis is accepted.

## 8. CALL TO ACTION (5%)
What should the reader do NOW? One clear, specific step.

## Rules
- Use subheadings throughout
- Write like you're explaining to a smart skeptic who cares about their kids
- Brand claims must align with your brand values and guidelines
- No manipulation — persuade with truth and story, not guilt
