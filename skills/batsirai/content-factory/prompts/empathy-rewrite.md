# Empathy Rewriter — Technical to Accessible

**Technical content:**
```
[TECHNICAL]
{text}
[/TECHNICAL]
```

**Target reader:** Someone who doesn't know the jargon, needs to understand why they should care, and wants to know "what do I do with this?"

## For Every Technical Term:
1. Define it in one sentence
2. Give a concrete example or analogy from everyday life
3. Explain why it matters to THEM (not why it matters technically)

## Structure

### What is this? 
Plain English. No assumptions about prior knowledge. If a smart 16-year-old wouldn't understand it, simplify further.

### Why should I care?
Benefits, not features. "This means your child..." not "This leverages..."

### How does it work?
Simplified explanation with real-world analogy. "Think of it like..." 

### What should I do next?
One clear action step. Specific. Not "consider exploring" — tell them what to DO.

## Test
Read the output and ask: Would a tired mom at 10pm understand this and know what to do? If no, simplify again.

## Rules
- No jargon survives without a plain-English companion
- No acronyms without expansion
- No "simply" or "just" (if it were simple, they wouldn't need this)
- Concrete beats abstract every time
