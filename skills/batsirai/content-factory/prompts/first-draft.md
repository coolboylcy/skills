Turn these rough notes into an article:

```
[NOTES]
{notes}
[/NOTES]
```

**Target length:** {word_count} words
**Audience:** {audience}
**Goal:** {goal — inform/persuade/teach/inspire}
**Voice:** {voice — founder/brand/persona}

## Instructions
- Keep my ideas and examples — don't replace them with generic ones
- Fix structure and flow
- Add an opening hook that stops the scroll
- Structure with clear H2 subheadings
- End with one clear action step or reflection
- Pass theological guardrails (no performance language, no conditional love)

## Structure
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences) — specific moment, question, or surprising truth
2. **Setup** — why this matters to the reader RIGHT NOW
3. **Body** — 3-5 sections, each with one clear point
4. **Close** — action step, reflection prompt, or identity affirmation
