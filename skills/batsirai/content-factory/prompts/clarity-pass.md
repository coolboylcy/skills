# Clarity Surgery

Rewrite this for maximum clarity:

```
[TEXT]
{text}
[/TEXT]
```

## Rules
- Cut word count by 30% minimum
- Remove: jargon, passive voice, hedge words ("perhaps", "might", "could", "somewhat", "really", "very")
- Replace abstract nouns with concrete verbs
- Break sentences over 20 words into shorter ones
- Keep technical terms only if the audience needs them — then define them
- Kill adverbs that don't earn their keep
- One clear point per paragraph

## Output
Show before/after word count.
Mark the 3 biggest improvements you made and why.
