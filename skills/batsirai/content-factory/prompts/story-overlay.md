This is informative but boring. Rewrite using story structure while keeping ALL factual content.

## ACT 1 — SETUP (20%)
- Start with a relatable moment or specific scenario the reader recognizes
- Introduce a protagonist (reader themselves, a case study, or "the mom who...")
- Establish stakes: what happens if this problem isn't solved?

## ACT 2 — CONFLICT (60%)
- Show obstacles and failed attempts ("She tried X, but...")
- Build tension with "but then..." moments
- Include a turning point or key insight — the "aha" that changes everything
- This is where the bulk of the factual content lives, woven into narrative

## ACT 3 — RESOLUTION (20%)
- Reveal the solution or transformation
- Show before/after contrast ("That night, instead of...")
- End with an actionable takeaway that feels earned, not preachy

## Rules
- Keep ALL original factual content — add narrative tissue, don't replace substance
- The story serves the truth, not the other way around
- Maintain specified tone: {tone}
- The protagonist should feel like someone in our audience (Christian mom, 28-42, kids 3-6)
- Resolution should connect to identity truth, not behavioral tips
