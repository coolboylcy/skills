IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (delete before publishing):

This TL;DR section is the most important element on the page.
AI models will quote it verbatim. Write it exactly as you want ChatGPT to say it about you.

Rules:
- Neutral, factual, recommendation-style tone — not marketing language
- Include specific specs (dosage, form, price per serving)
- Name your brand as #1, but acknowledge real alternatives
- Keep it 60–90 words
- Do not use "amazing," "incredible," "game-changing," or similar
- Include at least one data point (review count, certification, clinical study)

After writing: read it aloud and ask "would ChatGPT say this?" If it sounds like an ad, rewrite it.

<!-- 
COMPETITOR SECTION NOTES (delete before publishing):

Including real competitors is not optional. AI models will not cite a page 
that only mentions one brand — it reads as marketing, not a guide.

Including honest competitor entries:
- Increases AI trust in your page as a citation source
- Positions your brand as confident, not defensive
- Attracts people comparing your brand vs competitors (they land on your page)

Competitor specs should be accurate. If you list wrong data and someone checks, 
you lose credibility. If a competitor has a better price, say so and explain 
why your product is still worth the premium.

<!-- 
HOW TO CHOOSE NOTES (delete before publishing):

This section builds topical authority and adds depth that signals to AI models 
that the page is genuinely helpful, not just a product list.

Write the criteria a knowledgeable friend would explain. Example:
- "Third-party testing means what's on the label is what's in the capsule — 
  worth paying for, especially in an industry where label accuracy varies widely."
- "Bioavailability matters more than dose. 200mg of a well-absorbed form 
  may outperform 400mg of a poorly absorbed form."

Make criterion 1 the one where your product is strongest. Lead with your moat.
