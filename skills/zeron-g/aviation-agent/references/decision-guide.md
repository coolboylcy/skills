## VFR Weather Minimums — Quick Reference by Airspace

| Airspace | Visibility | Cloud Clearance | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Class B** | 3 SM | Clear of clouds | Requires ATC clearance to enter |
| **Class C** | 3 SM | 500↓ 1,000↑ 2,000→ | Requires radio contact |
| **Class D** | 3 SM | 500↓ 1,000↑ 2,000→ | Requires radio contact |
| **Class E** (< 10,000) | 3 SM | 500↓ 1,000↑ 2,000→ | |
| **Class E** (≥ 10,000) | 5 SM | 1,000↓ 1,000↑ 1 SM→ | |
| **Class G** (≤ 1,200 AGL, day) | 1 SM | Clear of clouds | |
| **Class G** (≤ 1,200 AGL, night) | 3 SM | 500↓ 1,000↑ 2,000→ | |
| **Class G** (> 1,200, < 10,000, day) | 1 SM | 500↓ 1,000↑ 2,000→ | |
| **Class G** (> 1,200, < 10,000, night) | 3 SM | 500↓ 1,000↑ 2,000→ | |
| **Class G** (≥ 10,000) | 5 SM | 1,000↓ 1,000↑ 1 SM→ | |

Legend: ↓ = below clouds, ↑ = above clouds, → = horizontal from clouds. All distances in feet unless noted.

## IFR Alternate Airport Weather Minimums

When filing IFR, an alternate airport is required if the destination's weather (from 1 hour before to 1 hour after ETA) is forecast below:
- Ceiling **2,000 ft** and visibility **3 SM**

The alternate itself must meet these minimums at ETA:

| Approach Type at Alternate | Ceiling | Visibility |
|---------------------------|---------|------------|
| **Precision approach** (ILS, etc.) | 600 ft | 2 SM |
| **Non-precision approach** (VOR, GPS, etc.) | 800 ft | 2 SM |

Memory aid: **"600-2 / 800-2"** (precision / non-precision).

If the alternate has no instrument approach, weather must allow descent from MEA and landing under basic VFR.

## Pre-Flight Decision Frameworks

### IMSAFE — Personal Fitness Checklist

Before every flight, assess yourself:

| Letter | Factor | Ask Yourself |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **I** | Illness | Am I feeling sick or have symptoms of illness? |
| **M** | Medication | Am I taking any medication that could impair judgment or performance? |
| **S** | Stress | Am I under significant psychological stress (work, personal, financial)? |
| **A** | Alcohol | Have I consumed alcohol in the last 8 hours? Am I under 0.04% BAC? |
| **F** | Fatigue | Did I get adequate sleep? Am I well-rested? |
| **E** | Eating/Emotion | Have I eaten properly? Am I emotionally fit to fly? |

**Rule**: If any factor is a definite "yes" (negative), do not fly. If borderline, raise personal minimums significantly.

### PAVE — Risk Assessment Checklist

Evaluate the four risk categories for the planned flight:

| Letter | Category | Key Questions |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **P** | Pilot | Am I current and proficient? When did I last fly this type of mission? IMSAFE check passed? |
| **A** | Aircraft | Is the aircraft airworthy? Enough fuel with reserves? Weight and balance within limits? Known squawks? |
| **V** | enVironment | Weather at departure, en route, and destination? NOTAMs? Terrain? Airspace restrictions? Day or night? |
| **E** | External pressures | Am I feeling pressured to complete this flight? "Get-there-itis"? Can I cancel without consequence? |

**Rule**: High risk in any single category = NO-GO or mitigate before flying. High risk in two or more = definite NO-GO.

## Personal Minimums by Pilot Experience

### Student Pilot

| Factor | Suggested Minimum |
|--------|------------------|
| Ceiling | ≥ 3,500 ft AGL |
| Visibility | ≥ 5 SM |
| Wind (total) | ≤ 12 kt |
| Crosswind | ≤ 6 kt |
| Gusts | ≤ 5 kt above steady |
| Precipitation | None |
| Conditions | Day VFR only |

### Private Pilot (PPL) — VFR Only

| Factor | Suggested Minimum |
|--------|------------------|
| Ceiling | ≥ 3,000 ft AGL |
| Visibility | ≥ 5 SM (day), ≥ 7 SM (night) |
| Wind (total) | ≤ 18 kt |
| Crosswind | ≤ 10 kt |
| Gusts | ≤ 8 kt above steady |
| Precipitation | Light only, no freezing precip |
| Conditions | Day and night VFR; avoid mountainous terrain at night |

### Instrument-Rated Pilot

| Factor | Suggested Minimum |
|--------|------------------|
| Ceiling | ≥ Published approach minimums + 200 ft |
| Visibility | ≥ Published minimums + 1/2 SM |
| Wind (total) | ≤ 25 kt |
| Crosswind | ≤ 15 kt |
| Gusts | ≤ 10 kt above steady |
| Convective activity | Avoid thunderstorms; ≥ 20 nm lateral clearance |
| Icing | Light icing only if equipped; no moderate/severe |

**Note**: These are *starting* suggestions. Adjust based on recency, familiarity with the aircraft, route, and airport.

## Common Weather Hazards — Quick Decision Guide

### Thunderstorms / Convective Activity
- **NO-GO** for all VFR pilots if thunderstorms are on or near the route
- IFR pilots: maintain ≥ 20 nm from cells; do not fly between cells less than 40 nm apart
- Never fly under a thunderstorm anvil
- Check: METAR for `TS`, TAF for `+TSRA` or `CB` in cloud layers

### Icing
- **NO-GO** for aircraft not certified for known icing (FIKI)
- Check: temperature between +2°C and -20°C with visible moisture = icing risk
- PIREP icing reports: moderate or severe = NO-GO for non-FIKI aircraft
- TAF/METAR: `FZRA`, `FZFG`, `FZDZ` all indicate freezing conditions

### Low Visibility / Fog
- **NO-GO** if below personal minimums
- Temp/dewpoint spread ≤ 3°C and decreasing = fog likely forming
- Radiation fog: common early morning calm wind clear sky; burns off by mid-morning
- Advection fog: can persist all day; requires wind shift to clear

### Turbulence
- Check PIREPs for reported turbulence intensity
- Light = acceptable for most pilots
- Moderate = uncomfortable, consider delay for low-experience pilots
- Severe = **NO-GO** for all GA aircraft
- Extreme = **NO-GO** for all aircraft

### High Winds / Wind Shear
- Surface gusts > 25 kt or crosswind > demonstrated crosswind component = NO-GO
- TAF `WS` groups indicate low-level wind shear near the airport
- Wind shear on approach: report to ATC, consider go-around or divert
