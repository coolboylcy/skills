# FAR Quick Reference — Part 61 & Part 91

## Part 61 — Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors

### 61.3 — Required Certificates and Documents

A pilot must have the following in their **physical possession** during flight:
- **Pilot certificate** (or student pilot certificate)
- **Photo ID** (government-issued)
- **Medical certificate** (appropriate class, or BasicMed documentation)

For IFR or night flight, the same documents apply. No additional certificates required beyond the appropriate rating.

**Medical certificate classes:**
| Class | Required For | Duration (under 40) | Duration (40+) |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1st | ATP | 12 months | 6 months |
| 2nd | Commercial | 12 months | 12 months |
| 3rd | Private/Recreational | 60 months | 24 months |

### 61.57 — Recent Flight Experience (Currency)

#### Passenger-Carrying Currency (Day VFR)
Within the preceding **90 days**, the PIC must have made:
- **3 takeoffs and 3 landings** in the same category, class, and type (if type rating required)
- Landings must be to a **full stop** if in a tailwheel aircraft

#### Night Passenger-Carrying Currency
Within the preceding **90 days**, the PIC must have made:
- **3 takeoffs and 3 landings to a full stop** during the period beginning 1 hour after sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise
- In the same category, class, and type

#### Instrument Currency
Within the preceding **6 calendar months**, the pilot must have performed under actual or simulated instrument conditions:
- **6 instrument approaches**
- **Holding procedures and tasks** (intercepting/tracking courses through the use of navigational electronic systems)

If instrument currency lapses (> 6 months but < 12 months): pilot may regain currency by completing the above requirements with a safety pilot or in an approved simulator.

If lapsed > 12 months: must pass an **Instrument Proficiency Check (IPC)** with a CFII or examiner.

### 61.89 — Student Pilot Limitations

A student pilot **may not**:
- Act as PIC of an aircraft carrying passengers
- Act as PIC for compensation or hire
- Act as PIC when flight visibility is less than **3 SM during day** or **5 SM at night**
- Act as PIC contrary to any limitation placed on the logbook endorsement
- Fly beyond the limitations of the solo cross-country endorsement

A student pilot **may** act as PIC only when:
- In possession of a current student pilot certificate and medical
- Under the supervision (endorsement) of an authorized flight instructor
- Solo flight is limited to the endorsements given (specific make/model, airports, cross-country routes)

## Part 91 — General Operating and Flight Rules

### 91.155 — Basic VFR Weather Minimums

#### Class B Airspace
| | Visibility | Cloud Clearance |
|-|-----------|-----------------|
| **All altitudes** | 3 SM | Clear of clouds |

#### Class C Airspace
| | Visibility | Cloud Clearance |
|-|-----------|-----------------|
| **All altitudes** | 3 SM | 500 ft below, 1,000 ft above, 2,000 ft horizontal |

#### Class D Airspace
| | Visibility | Cloud Clearance |
|-|-----------|-----------------|
| **All altitudes** | 3 SM | 500 ft below, 1,000 ft above, 2,000 ft horizontal |

#### Class E Airspace
| Altitude | Visibility | Cloud Clearance |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Below 10,000 ft MSL | 3 SM | 500 ft below, 1,000 ft above, 2,000 ft horizontal |
| At or above 10,000 ft MSL | 5 SM | 1,000 ft below, 1,000 ft above, 1 SM horizontal |

#### Class G Airspace
| Altitude / Time | Visibility | Cloud Clearance |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1,200 ft AGL or below, **Day** | 1 SM | Clear of clouds |
| 1,200 ft AGL or below, **Night** | 3 SM | 500 ft below, 1,000 ft above, 2,000 ft horizontal |
| Above 1,200 ft AGL, below 10,000 ft MSL, **Day** | 1 SM | 500 ft below, 1,000 ft above, 2,000 ft horizontal |
| Above 1,200 ft AGL, below 10,000 ft MSL, **Night** | 3 SM | 500 ft below, 1,000 ft above, 2,000 ft horizontal |
| Above 1,200 ft AGL, at or above 10,000 ft MSL | 5 SM | 1,000 ft below, 1,000 ft above, 1 SM horizontal |

### 91.157 — Special VFR (SVFR)

Special VFR allows operations within the lateral boundaries of Class B, C, D, or E surface area when weather is below basic VFR minimums:

- **Requirements**: ATC clearance required, flight visibility at least **1 SM**, remain **clear of clouds**
- **At night**: Pilot must be **instrument rated** and aircraft must be **instrument equipped**
- Some airports prohibit SVFR (listed in FAA Chart Supplement with "NO SVFR")

### 91.185 — IFR Operations: Two-Way Radio Communications Failure

When two-way radio communications are lost in IFR conditions, use the **AVE-F** memory aid:

#### Route — AVE
Fly the following route, in this order of priority:
1. **A — Assigned**: The route last assigned by ATC
2. **V — Vectored**: If being radar vectored, fly direct to the fix/route/airway specified in the vector clearance
3. **E — Expected**: The route ATC has told you to expect

#### Altitude — F (Fly the Highest)
For each segment of the route, fly the **highest** of:
- **M — MEA**: Minimum En Route Altitude for the segment
- **E — Expected**: The altitude ATC has told you to expect
- **A — Assigned**: The altitude last assigned by ATC

#### Approach
- Proceed to the destination and commence an approach as close as possible to the **EFC (Expect Further Clearance) time** or, if no EFC was received, the **ETA** filed or amended en route
- If holding is required before the approach, leave the holding fix at the EFC time

### 91.211 — Supplemental Oxygen Requirements

#### Unpressurized Aircraft

| Cabin Pressure Altitude | Requirement |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **12,500 – 14,000 ft MSL** | Required flight crew oxygen after **30 minutes** at this altitude |
| **Above 14,000 ft MSL** | Required flight crew oxygen for the **entire time** at this altitude |
| **Above 15,000 ft MSL** | Each occupant must be **provided** supplemental oxygen (passengers must have it available) |

#### Pressurized Aircraft
- Flight crew must have oxygen available when flying above **FL250** (25,000 ft)
- One pilot must wear and use an oxygen mask above **FL350** (35,000 ft) unless both pilots are at the controls
- If cabin pressurization fails above 14,000 ft, oxygen must be available for passengers for the descent
