## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since TrustMyAgent is designed to secure AI agents, any vulnerability in its checks or telemetry could lead to false assurance.

If you find a security issue, **please do NOT open a public issue**. Instead, email **[security@anecdotes.ai](mailto:security@anecdotes.ai)** with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact (e.g., check bypass, telemetry tampering)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline

1. **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours
2. **Initial assessment** within 1 week
3. **Progress updates** until resolution
4. **Security advisory** published after the fix, with credit to you (if desired)

Thank you for helping keep the AI agent ecosystem secure.
