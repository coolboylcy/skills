# Email Access Strategy

## Preferred Path
Use Google Workspace tooling (`gog`) to:
1. Verify account/session is authenticated.
2. Search for recent verification emails from DataHive.
3. Open latest relevant email and extract the verification URL or code.

## Search Patterns
Use these query terms when searching:
- `DataHive verification`
- `DataHive confirm`
- `from:datahive`
- `subject:(verify OR confirmation)`

## Operational Notes
- Always verify timestamp recency before using a code/link.
- Prefer newest unused message.
- If multiple codes exist, invalidate stale assumptions and use the latest one.
