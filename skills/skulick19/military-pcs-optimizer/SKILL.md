# Military PCS Optimizer

The most comprehensive PCS skill available. Built by an active-duty service member.

## What This Skill Does

When a service member asks about PCS moves, this skill:

1. **Gathers their situation** — branch, rank, dependents, origin/destination, CONUS/OCONUS
2. **Calculates entitlements** — DLA, TLE/TLA, MALT, per diem, PPM/DITY estimates, BAH/OHA, COLA
3. **Generates a personalized timeline** — checklist from orders received through post-arrival
4. **Maximizes their money** — identifies entitlements people commonly miss
