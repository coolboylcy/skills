| Retail-to-service ratio | 20-30% | Below 10% |
| Client retention rate | 60-80% | Below 50% |

## Compensation Models

### Booth Rental
- Stylist pays $200-$600/week for chair
- Keeps 100% of service revenue
- Salon provides space + utilities only
- Stylist is 1099 contractor — no benefits, no scheduling control
- Risk: IRS reclassification if salon controls hours/pricing

### Commission
- Standard: 40-55% commission on services
- Senior/master level: 50-60%
- Retail commission: 10-20% of product sales
- Salon controls pricing, scheduling, brand standards
- Employees (W-2) — payroll taxes, potential benefits

### Hybrid (Team-Based)
- Base hourly ($12-$18) + commission kicker above threshold
- Example: $15/hr base + 40% commission on revenue above $800/week
- Encourages productivity while providing income floor
- Growing trend — reduces turnover

### Tips
- Industry standard: 15-20% of service price
- Salon should never take a cut of tips (legal in most states, terrible for retention)
- Credit card tip processing fees: salon absorbs or splits — absorbing builds trust

## Licensing & Compliance (US)

### State Board Requirements
| License Type | Typical Hours Required | Exam |
|-------------|----------------------|------|
| Cosmetologist | 1,000-1,600 hours | Written + practical |
| Esthetician | 300-750 hours | Written + practical |
| Nail Technician | 300-600 hours | Written + practical |
| Massage Therapist | 500-1,000 hours | MBLEx (most states) |
| Barber | 1,000-1,500 hours | Written + practical |

### Med Spa Additional Requirements

- Laser devices: varies by state — some require RN/NP, others allow trained techs
- HIPAA compliance mandatory for patient records
- Separate malpractice insurance for medical procedures

## Scheduling Optimization

### Revenue Maximization Framework
1. **Peak hours** (Sat 9AM-2PM, Thu-Fri 4-8PM): Book highest-ticket services
2. **Express lane**: 15-30 min services (brow wax, bang trim, blowout) fill gaps
3. **Double-booking**: Color processing time = overlap with another client (experienced stylists only)
4. **Online booking**: Reduces phone time 60-70%, captures after-hours bookings
5. **Deposit policy**: $25-$50 deposit for services over $100 — cuts no-shows 50-70%
6. **Cancellation policy**: 24-48 hour notice, charge 50% for late cancels
7. **Waitlist automation**: Fill cancellations within minutes via text alerts

### Seasonal Revenue Calendar
| Month | Focus | Promotion Strategy |
|-------|-------|--------------------|
| Jan-Feb | New Year refresh | Package deals, gift card redemption push |
| Mar-Apr | Spring events, prom | Updo packages, color refresh |
| May-Jun | Wedding season, summer prep | Bridal packages, waxing memberships |
| Jul-Aug | Summer maintenance | Color protection, UV treatments |
| Sep-Oct | Back-to-school, fall color | Rich color services, deep conditioning |
| Nov-Dec | Holiday parties, gift season | Gift card sales (push 15-20% of annual revenue), party packages |

## Retail Strategy

### Product Mix
- **Professional haircare**: 50-60% of retail (Olaplex, Redken, Pureology, Kevin Murphy)
- **Skincare**: 20-25% (medical-grade if esti services offered)
- **Tools & accessories**: 10-15%
- **Specialty/seasonal**: 5-10%

### Markup Standards
- Professional products: 50-100% markup (buy at $12, sell at $24)
- Private label: 200-400% markup (highest margin — build your brand)
- Tools (flat irons, brushes): 40-60% markup

### Retail Conversion Tactics
1. Use it during service → client feels the result → recommend at checkout
2. "Prescribe, don't sell" — stylists are authorities, not salespeople
3. Loyalty program: buy 5 get 1 free on repeat products
4. Subscription model: auto-ship every 6-8 weeks with 10% discount
5. Travel sizes at checkout counter for impulse purchases

## Growth Playbook

### Stage 1: Solo/New Salon (Year 1)
- Target: $150K-$250K revenue
- Focus: Client acquisition, Google reviews (100+ reviews = dominant local SEO)
- Spend: 5-8% of revenue on marketing (Instagram, Google Ads, Yelp)

### Stage 2: Team Building (Year 2-3)
- Target: $400K-$800K revenue
- Add 2-4 service providers
- Introduce commission structure + retail incentives
- Systems: booking software, inventory management, client records

### Stage 3: Multi-Location/Brand (Year 4+)
- Target: $1M+ revenue
- SOPs for everything — replication-ready
- Manager role (not owner in chair)
- Consider franchising or licensing the brand
- Corporate accounts, event contracts, influencer partnerships

### Client Acquisition Cost Benchmarks
| Channel | CAC | Lifetime Value Multiple |
|---------|-----|------------------------|
| Google My Business (free) | $0 | Best ROI — optimize relentlessly |
| Instagram organic | $5-$15 | High — visual proof of work |
| Google Ads (local) | $15-$40 | Good for new salons |
| Yelp Ads | $20-$50 | Declining but still relevant |
| Referral program | $10-$25 (credit given) | Highest conversion rate |
| Influencer collab | $50-$200 | Variable — track carefully |

## Red Flags — Common Mistakes
1. **Pricing too low** — Race to bottom destroys margins. Charge what you're worth.
2. **No retail program** — Leaving 20-30% revenue on the table.
3. **Booth rental with control** — IRS classifies as employee. Fines + back taxes.
4. **No prebook system** — Clients who don't rebook at checkout have 40% lower retention.
5. **Ignoring online reviews** — 90% of new clients check Google/Yelp first.
6. **No cancellation policy** — No-shows cost US salons $67B/year.
7. **Over-discounting** — Groupon/discount clients rarely convert to full-price. Build value instead.
8. **Skipping continuing education** — Trends change fast. Budget $500-$2,000/year per stylist.
