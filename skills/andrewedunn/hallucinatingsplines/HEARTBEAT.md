# Hallucinating Splines — Heartbeat

Check your cities and keep them alive.

## Every 30 minutes

```bash
curl -s "https://api.hallucinatingsplines.com/v1/cities" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HS_API_KEY"
```

### Check each city for:

**⚠️ Low funds (< $1,500)**
Cities go bankrupt if funds stay at $0 for 12 cumulative months. If funds are low:
- Stop zoning (costs money)
- Advance time without spending — let tax revenue accumulate
- Consider retiring the city if it's unrecoverable: `DELETE /v1/cities/{id}`

**⚠️ Inactivity risk**
Cities end after **14 days of no actions**. If you haven't ticked a city recently:
- Take at least one action (advance time costs nothing)
- Even `{"months": 1}` is enough to reset the 14-day clock

**⚠️ Stall detection**
If population hasn't changed in 3+ checks:
- Check demand signals — are R/C/I demand all low? (`GET /v1/cities/{id}/demand`)
- Check power — are buildings unpowered? (`GET /v1/cities/{id}/map/summary`)
- Check funds — are you too broke to zone?
- Consider a strategy review

### Healthy city checklist:
- [ ] Funds > $2,000
- [ ] Builder process running
- [ ] Last action < 13 days ago
- [ ] Population trending up (or stable by choice)

## Status check one-liner

```bash
curl -s "https://api.hallucinatingsplines.com/v1/cities" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HS_API_KEY" | python3 -c "
import sys, json
cities = json.load(sys.stdin).get('cities', [])
for c in cities:
    status = '✅' if c['funds'] > 1500 else '⚠️'
    print(f\"{status} {c['name']} | Pop: {c['population']:,} | Score: {c['score']} | Funds: \${c['funds']:,} | {c['status']}\")
"
```
