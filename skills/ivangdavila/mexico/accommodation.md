# Accommodation Guide — Mexico

## Booking Strategy

1. Use fewer bases and stay 2+ nights where possible.
2. Prioritize neighborhood fit, not only lowest nightly price.
3. Book high-demand holiday periods earlier than expected.

## Mexico City

- **Best convenience:** Roma, Condesa, Reforma-connected zones
- **Best value compromise:** Juarez edge and selected Narvarte pockets
- **Watch:** Overpaying in the busiest tourist strips

## Oaxaca

- **Best convenience:** Centro perimeter for walkability
- **Better vibe/value mix:** Jalatlaco and nearby calmer streets

## Guadalajara

- **Best convenience:** Americana and Lafayette area stays
- **Classic option:** Centro for daytime heritage access

## Yucatan and Riviera Maya

- **Cancun:** smooth airport logistics, broad hotel inventory
- **Playa del Carmen:** better walkable mixed-trip base
- **Tulum:** style-driven, often higher pricing and transport friction
- **Merida:** best value for culture-first inland routes

## Property Types

| Style | Best for | Tradeoff |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Hotel | Simple city stays | Higher nightly pricing in top zones |
| Boutique | Atmosphere and design | Variable consistency |
| Apartment | Longer stays and families | More planning overhead |
| Resort | Beach-first convenience | Less local city immersion |
