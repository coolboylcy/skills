## Practical Dining Rules

- Lunch often gives better value than prime dinner slots.
- In busy districts, one or two blocks away often improves quality-price ratio.
- Street food quality signal is turnover, cleanliness rhythm, and focused menus.

## Food Traps to Avoid

1. Social-media-heavy spots with long queues and average execution.
2. Staying only in polished tourist strips and missing neighborhood dining.
3. Overplanning tasting-heavy days without hydration and pacing.
4. Assuming every famous market stall is best at all hours.
