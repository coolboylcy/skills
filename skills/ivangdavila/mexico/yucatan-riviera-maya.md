# Yucatan and Riviera Maya Complete Guide

## Core Reality

This region is not one single base decision. Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Tulum, and Merida support different trip styles and transfer patterns.

## Base Strategy

### Cancun
- Best for direct flight convenience and resort-focused trips
- Easier short stays if beach + airport logistics are priority

### Playa del Carmen
- Better for mixed beach plus food plus day-trip flexibility
- Walkable zones, but tourist-core pricing can be inflated

### Tulum
- Strong for design hotels and beach-club scene
- Higher price volatility and variable transport value

### Merida (Yucatan inland)
- Culture and food depth with easier access to Uxmal and inland routes
- Best for travelers wanting less beach density and more city rhythm

## Route Rules

- Keep fewer bases and 2+ nights per base where possible.
- Pair ruins and cenotes by geography, not social-media checklist order.
- Build midday rest windows in humid months.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Treating Cancun to Tulum movement as frictionless at all times.
2. Overstacking beach, ruins, and nightlife without recovery windows.
3. Booking no-flex stays during volatile weather periods.
4. Choosing isolated stays without clear transport plan.
