# Transport Guide — Mexico

## In Cities

- Mexico City: Metro, Metrobus, and rideshare cover many visitor routes.
- Guadalajara and Monterrey style cities: mixed transit plus rideshare is common.
- Walkability varies by neighborhood, so route by zone instead of city-wide assumptions.

## Intercity

### Flights
- Best for long-distance region jumps.
- Add transfer buffer around major holiday or weather-affected windows.

### Long-distance buses
- Strong coverage between many major and mid-size cities.
- Premium classes are often comfortable and practical for overnight or medium routes.

### Car rental
- Best for selected regional loops where public transport is limited.
- Daylight driving and toll-road planning improve safety and predictability.

## Payment and Tools

- Keep both digital payment and some cash flexibility.
- Use live transport updates where available for disruption checks.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Assuming same-day multi-region movement is always realistic.
2. Booking tight transfers before fixed tours.
3. Driving unfamiliar routes at night without clear necessity.
