# Beaches and Coastal Stops — Mexico

## Caribbean Side

- **Playa del Carmen corridor:** convenient mixed base with broad services
- **Isla Mujeres:** easy day-trip beach rhythm from Cancun area
- **Cozumel:** diving and reef focus with structured day planning

## Pacific Side

- **Puerto Escondido:** surf and laid-back pace, strong sunset flow
- **Sayulita and Nayarit pockets:** social beach vibe with weekend demand spikes
- **Los Cabos coast zones:** polished resort routes with desert-coast contrast

## Lower-Crowd Alternatives

- Build in one less-saturated beach day outside the most famous strips.
- Pair beach plans with nearby town food stops for better day balance.

## Practical Notes

- Midday heat and UV can be intense most of the year.
- Sargassum periods can affect some Caribbean beaches.
- Parking and transfers can dominate time in peak periods.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Planning beach-only days with no weather or algae backup.
2. Underestimating heat and hydration needs.
3. Making long detours for one short stop with no route efficiency.
