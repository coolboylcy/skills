## Oaxaca Strategy

- Stay at least 2-3 nights to combine food, culture, and one day route.
- Book mezcal tastings and top restaurants ahead on weekends.
- Use midday breaks in hotter months before evening plans.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Trying to do Monte Alban plus long artisan route in one rushed day.
2. Treating Oaxaca as only a quick stop between bigger destinations.
3. Assuming every popular mezcal venue takes walk-ins at peak hours.
