# Mexico with Kids

## Good Family Bases

| Base | Why it works |
|------|--------------|
| Mexico City | Large mix of parks, museums, and easy day planning |
| Merida | Family-friendly rhythm, culture plus manageable day routes |
| Oaxaca | Compact center with strong food and cultural activities |
| Playa del Carmen area | Beach access with broad accommodation options |

## Family Planning Rules

- Keep transfer legs shorter than map intuition suggests.
- Plan one anchor activity per day plus flexible downtime.
- Build indoor or low-exposure backups for rain or peak heat.

## Age-Based Tips

### Younger kids
- Short activities, shaded breaks, and predictable meal windows

### Older kids
- Mix ruins, food experiences, and one active element daily

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overbooking long transfer-heavy days.
2. Ignoring heat and hydration plans.
3. Booking accommodation far from daily activity zones.
