# Hiking Guide — Mexico

## Core Rule

Pick hikes by altitude, heat, and current conditions, not only photos.

## Strong Areas

### Central Highlands
- Nevado de Toluca and nearby altitude routes require conditioning and early starts.

### Oaxaca region
- Mountain and valley trails can be rewarding with local guidance.

### Baja and canyon routes
- Desert exposure means sun, water, and timing discipline are critical.

## Safety Basics

- Start early to avoid peak heat and storms.
- Carry extra water, sun protection, and offline maps.
- Respect altitude adaptation on higher-elevation routes.
- Turn back when conditions degrade.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Casual shoes on rocky or wet routes.
2. Ignoring altitude effect on pace and recovery.
3. Starting too late in heat-heavy areas.
4. Treating all posted route times as universal.
