# Regions Overview — Mexico

## Main Travel Regions

| Region | Trip Identity |
|--------|---------------|
| Mexico City | Museums, neighborhoods, food density, transit-first exploration |
| Oaxaca | Culture, cuisine depth, artisan and mezcal routes |
| Jalisco (Guadalajara + Tequila) | Urban culture with easy thematic day routes |
| Yucatan Peninsula | Ruins, cenotes, colonial cities, tropical pacing |
| Riviera Maya corridor | Beach and resort-heavy with transfer logistics complexity |
| Baja California | Wine, coast, desert landscapes, road-trip logic |
| Central Highlands | Colonial cities and cooler weather alternatives |

## Route Planning Rule

Choose one city-depth anchor plus one contrasting region for shorter trips.
For longer trips, use 2-3 bases max to avoid transfer-heavy fatigue.
