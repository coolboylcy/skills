# Nightlife Guide — Mexico

## Mexico City

### Best zones
- **Roma and Condesa:** cocktail bars, music spots, varied pacing
- **Juarez:** strong modern bar density
- **Polanco:** polished but often higher spend profile

## Guadalajara

### Best zones
- Americana and Lafayette corridors for mixed bars and late dining
- Weekend demand can be intense in top venues

## Oaxaca

### Best zones
- Centro and nearby side streets for mezcal bars and live-music pockets
- Better pacing than very large-city club circuits

## Coastal Zones

- Cancun and Playa have broad party options with high variability in value.
- Tulum nightlife can be high-cost and transport-sensitive.

## Practical Notes

- Peak Fri/Sat windows can produce long queues.
- Late-night transport should be decided before final venue.
- Venue quality differs block by block in tourist-heavy areas.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Assuming every famous venue means best experience.
2. Staying only in highest-tourist nightlife strips.
3. Starting too late without reservations or queue tolerance.
