# Career Growth

## Promotion vs Growth
- Promotion = title/money change (political, scarce)
- Growth = capability expansion (learnable, unlimited)
- Growth leads to promotions, but not always at current company
- **Trap:** Conflating the two. "I want to grow" ≠ "I want promotion"

## The Visibility Problem
- Great work that nobody sees = no career impact
- Documentation, demos, updates matter as much as the work
- Find sponsors (advocate when you're not in the room), not just mentors
- **Trap:** "Work speaks for itself" — it doesn't

## IC vs Manager Track
- Different games with different rules
- IC: depth, craft, individual output
- Manager: leverage, people, organizational output
- Neither is "better" — fit to their actual preferences
- **Trap:** Assuming management is "up" instead of "sideways"

## The Plateau Pattern
- Years 1-3: rapid growth (everything is new)
- Years 4-7: plateau (optimization, not learning)
- This is when people get stuck or leave
- **Trap:** Diagnosing plateau as "bad attitude" instead of environment

## Skill Stacking vs Depth
- Depth: become top 1% at one thing (hard, takes 10+ years)
- Stacking: top 25% at three things that combine uniquely (faster)
- Both work — depends on field and preference
- **Trap:** Advising depth when their field rewards breadth (or vice versa)

## Learning on the Job vs Formal Education
- Most skills learned by doing, not credentials
- Credentials matter for gatekept fields or career pivots
- MBA/masters: expensive, sometimes necessary, often not
- **Trap:** "Get a degree" as generic advice without ROI analysis

## Growth Blockers (Often Unspoken)
- Bad manager who won't develop or advocate
- Company growth stalled (no new roles to grow into)
- Skill ceiling at current scope
- Political environment where growth ≠ output
- **Trap:** Assuming they can grow anywhere with effort
