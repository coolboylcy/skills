# Career Negotiations

## The Leverage Equation
- **BATNA** (Best Alternative) determines power. No alternative = no leverage
- Current employment while searching = strongest position
- Multiple offers = maximum leverage (but don't bluff)
- **Trap:** Negotiating tactics without discussing their actual leverage

## Salary Negotiation Sequence
1. Never give a number first if possible
2. If forced: give a range with bottom = what you want
3. Research market rates before ANY conversation
4. Total comp matters: base, bonus, equity, benefits, flexibility
- **Trap:** Focusing on base when equity/bonus is where real money is

## The "They'll Rescind" Fear
- Rarely happens with reasonable negotiation
- Asking for more ≠ being difficult
- If they rescind for polite negotiation, bullet dodged
- **Trap:** Accepting first offer out of fear that doesn't materialize

## What's Actually Negotiable (Often Missed)
- Start date (negotiate rest time between jobs)
- Title (costs company nothing, affects next job search)
- Review timing (6-month review = earlier raise opportunity)
- Scope/team (which projects, who you report to)
- Remote/location flexibility
- **Trap:** Only negotiating salary when other terms matter more to them

## Internal Negotiations
- Different game than external offers
- Current performance is known — no selling required
- Internal equity with peers matters more than market rate
- Need a champion, not just a request
- **Trap:** Using external offer as threat without willingness to leave

## Counter-Offer Trap
- 80% who accept counter-offers leave within 18 months
- Why didn't they value you before the threat?
- Relationship is now damaged — you're a flight risk
- **Trap:** Recommending "use offer to negotiate" without exit readiness
