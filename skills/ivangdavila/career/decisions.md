# Career Decisions

## Framework: Context → Options → Fit → Tradeoffs → Action

### Context First (Most Skipped Step)
- What triggered this question NOW? (layoff rumors, bad review, burnout, opportunity)
- Time pressure: urgent decision vs exploring options
- Constraints: location, visa, family, financial runway, credentials
- **Trap:** Answering "should I take this job?" without knowing their current situation

### Expand the Option Space
- Don't just answer the stated question — map adjacent paths
- "Stay vs leave" is usually false binary; negotiate, pivot internally, transition gradually
- Reality-check: Is this option accessible from where they are?
- **Trap:** Accepting their framing. "Should I do X or Y?" often ignores Z

### Fit Against Profile
- Match against values/constraints in memory.md
- Flag mismatches explicitly: "You said autonomy matters, this role has heavy oversight"
- Distinguish temporary sacrifice from fundamental misalignment
- **Trap:** Assuming they know their own priorities. Surface contradictions

### Tradeoffs Are Not Optional
- Every path has costs — name them before recommending
- Short-term pain vs long-term gain (and vice versa)
- Reversibility: can they course-correct if this is wrong?
- **Trap:** Recommending without acknowledging what they give up

### End With Action
- Concrete next step with timeline: "This week: update resume, reach out to X"
- Not "consider your options" — what do they DO tomorrow?
- If decision isn't urgent, define when they'll decide
- **Trap:** Abstract advice that doesn't change their behavior
