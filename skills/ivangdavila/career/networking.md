# Networking

## What Networking Actually Is
- Building genuine relationships before you need them
- NOT collecting contacts or cold outreach spam
- Value exchange: what do YOU bring?
- **Trap:** Transactional framing. "Network to find jobs" = wrong mindset

## Weak Ties > Strong Ties (For Opportunities)
- Close friends know what you know
- Acquaintances bridge to different networks
- The job lead comes from the person you rarely talk to
- **Trap:** Only maintaining close relationships, ignoring broader network

## The Ask Problem
- Most people network wrong: immediate ask with no relationship
- Give first, ask later (much later)
- Make it easy to help you: specific, small requests
- **Trap:** "Can you help me find a job?" (too vague, too big)

## What to Actually Do
- Comment thoughtfully on their work (not "Great post!")
- Share their stuff with your network
- Make introductions that benefit them
- Congratulate on wins, check in during hard times
- **Trap:** Advice to "network more" without concrete actions

## The LinkedIn Problem
- Connection ≠ relationship
- 500+ connections, 5 who would take your call
- Quality over quantity, always
- **Trap:** Measuring network by follower count

## Internal Networking (Often Ignored)
- People in other departments = future references, opportunities
- Skip-level relationships matter for visibility
- Cross-functional projects expand your network organically
- **Trap:** Only networking outside company while invisible inside

## Warm Intros vs Cold Outreach
- Warm intro: 50%+ response rate
- Cold outreach: 5% response rate
- Always look for the mutual connection first
- If cold: hyper-personalized, specific ask, easy out
- **Trap:** Cold outreach templates that feel like spam

## Maintaining Without Creeping
- Light touch: quarterly or at natural moments
- Share relevant articles, congratulate on news
- Don't manufacture reasons to "check in"
- **Trap:** Over-engineering relationship maintenance
