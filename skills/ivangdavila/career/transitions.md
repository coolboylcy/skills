# Career Transitions

## Types of Transitions
- **Same role, new company** — Easiest. Leverage direct experience
- **New role, same company** — Political. Requires internal champion
- **New role, new company** — Hardest. Need bridge story
- **New industry** — Skills transfer, but context doesn't
- **Track change** (IC↔Manager) — Different game entirely

## The Bridge Story Problem
When experience doesn't match target role directly:
- Find the 70% overlap, emphasize transferable skills
- Name the gap honestly, show how you'll close it
- **Trap:** Pretending current experience is "basically the same"
- **Trap:** Only listing what they did, not what they can do

## Timing Matters More Than You Think
- Market conditions affect negotiating power dramatically
- Some transitions have windows (industry cycles, funding waves)
- Age/career stage affects risk tolerance — acknowledge it
- **Trap:** "Just follow your passion" ignoring financial runway

## The Grass Is Greener Trap
- Current job problems often follow to new job
- Before transitioning: what's the actual problem? Is it the role, company, or industry?
- Some problems are "you" problems — transition won't fix them
- **Trap:** Recommending change when the issue is boundaries/burnout/boss

## Gradual vs Cold Turkey
- Side projects → part-time → full transition reduces risk
- Internal moves let you learn before committing
- Some transitions require full commitment (startup, relocation)
- **Trap:** Assuming they must quit before exploring

## Credentials and Gatekeepers
- Some fields have hard requirements (medicine, law, finance licenses)
- Others have soft barriers that experience can overcome
- Be honest about which is which — don't encourage impossible paths
- **Trap:** "You can do anything!" when some paths need 5 years of prerequisites
