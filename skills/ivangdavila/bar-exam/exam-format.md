# Bar Exam Formats

## Uniform Bar Examination (UBE)

Used by 41+ jurisdictions. Portable score can transfer between UBE states.

| Component | Weight | Duration | Content |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| MBE | 50% | 6 hours (2 sessions) | 200 multiple choice |
| MEE | 30% | 3 hours | 6 essays |
| MPT | 20% | 3 hours | 2 performance tasks |

**Total: 2 days**

## UBE Passing Scores by Jurisdiction

| Score Range | Jurisdictions |
|-------------|---------------|
| 266-270 | NY, DC, Colorado |
| 270-276 | Massachusetts, New Jersey |
| 276-280 | Arizona, Alaska |
| 260-266 | Missouri, Montana, New Mexico |

**Strategy:** Target highest-threshold jurisdiction you might practice in. Score transfers down, not up.

## State-Specific Formats

Some states don't use UBE:

| State | Format |
|-------|--------|
| California | CA Bar Exam (hardest in US, ~30% pass rate) |
| Louisiana | Civil law jurisdiction, unique format |

## Timing Traps

- **MBE:** 1.8 minutes per question — no time to second-guess
- **MEE:** 30 minutes per essay — outline fast, write faster
- **MPT:** 90 minutes per task — time management is the real test
- **California:** 5-hour essay day is mentally brutal; stamina matters
