# Choosing a Neighborhood in Seoul

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: What's Your Priority?

| If You Value... | Consider |
|-----------------|----------|
| Career networking | Gangnam, Seocho |
| Nightlife/social life | Hongdae, Itaewon |
| International comfort | Itaewon, Hannam |
| Budget-conscious living | Sinchon, Mapo, outer Jongno |
| Families (international schools) | Hannam, Yongsan, Pangyo |
| Families (Korean schools) | Songpa, Bundang, Seocho |
| Traditional atmosphere | Jongno, Bukchon |
| Tech industry (Pangyo commute) | Seocho, Bundang, Gangnam |
| Creative/artistic scene | Hongdae, Yeonnam, Seochon |
| Quiet residential | Seocho, Bundang, Hannam |

### Step 2: What's Your Budget?

**Monthly total budget (rent + living):**

| Budget (₩M/month) | Realistic Areas |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| <1.5M | Sinchon, Noryangjin, outer Mapo, older Jongno |
| 1.5-2.5M | Hongdae, Yeonnam, Mapo, Yongsan, standard apartments |
| 2.5-4M | Gangnam, Seocho, Itaewon, newer apartments |
| 4M+ | Hannam, Cheongdam, premium anywhere |

### Step 3: Commute Reality

Where do you need to go daily?

**If working in Gangnam/Seocho:**
- Live: Gangnam, Seocho (walk), Bundang (Sinbundang Line), Songpa
- Avoid: Jongno (long), Hongdae (30+ min)

**If working in Pangyo (tech):**
- Live: Seocho (Sinbundang), Bundang (local), Gangnam
- Commute: 20-40 minutes reasonable

**If working remotely:**
- Flexibility! Choose by lifestyle preference
- Consider: Yeonnam (cafés), Mapo (affordable), Seochon (peaceful)

**If studying (university):**
- Hongik/Yonsei/Ewha → Hongdae, Sinchon
- SNU → Nakseongdae, Sillim
- Korea University → Anam, Cheongnyangni

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Choosing by Instagram
**Mistake**: Picking Bukchon because photos are beautiful
**Reality**: Tourist crowds, limited housing, old amenities
**Fix**: Visit at night, talk to residents, check availability

### 2. Underestimating Commute
**Mistake**: Cheap rent far from work
**Reality**: Seoul metro is great, but 1+ hour commutes drain you
**Rule**: Max 40-45 minutes door-to-door

### 3. Ignoring Hill Factor
**Mistake**: Not realizing Itaewon/HBC/Hannam are HILLY
**Reality**: Daily steep walks, hard in summer/winter
**Fix**: Walk the neighborhood before signing

### 4. Weekend vs Weekday Vibe
**Mistake**: Visiting Hongdae on Sunday, thinking it's calm
**Reality**: Friday/Saturday = chaos
**Fix**: Visit at multiple times

### 5. Jeonse Without Capital
**Mistake**: Planning jeonse without ₩150M+ ready
**Reality**: Jeonse requires huge upfront deposit
**Fix**: Budget for wolse or save for years

---

## Rent Negotiation Tips

### For Wolse
1. Ask about reducing deposit to increase monthly
2. Multi-year contracts = possible discount
3. Move-in during off-season (winter) = better deals
4. New buildings offer incentives (free months)

### For Jeonse
1. Larger deposit = possible rent reduction
2. Verify ownership (등기부등본) before paying
3. Use official 공인중개사 (licensed agent)
4. Jeonse insurance available (전세보증보험)

### Red Flags
- Agent pressuring quick decision
- No proper contract (계약서)
- Can't verify ownership
- Deposit to personal account (not escrow)

## Seasonal Considerations

| Moving in... | Notes |
|--------------|-------|
| Spring (Mar-May) | High demand, university start |
| Summer (Jun-Aug) | Monsoon, harder moving |
| Fall (Sep-Nov) | Second high demand |
| Winter (Dec-Feb) | Best deals, fewer options |

**Tip**: March and September = peak moving season (학기 starts). Prices higher, competition fierce.
