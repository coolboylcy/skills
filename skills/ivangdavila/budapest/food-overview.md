# Budapest Food Scene Overview

## The Dining Landscape

Budapest has transformed from post-communist food desert to genuine culinary destination. The scene combines:

- **Hungarian revival**: Traditional dishes reimagined
- **International diversity**: Every cuisine represented
- **Price advantage**: 40-60% cheaper than Western Europe
- **Wine excellence**: Underrated Hungarian wines

## Hungarian Cuisine Basics

### Flavors to Know
- **Paprika**: The defining spice (sweet, hot, smoked varieties)
- **Sour cream (tejföl)**: On everything
- **Onions**: Base of most dishes
- **Caraway**: Common in breads, soups
- **Dill**: Fresh herbs in salads, sauces

### Meal Structure
- **Breakfast (reggeli)**: Light — coffee and pastry
- **Lunch (ebéd)**: Main meal traditionally (12-2pm)
- **Dinner (vacsora)**: Lighter than lunch historically, now similar

### What "Hungarian" Actually Means
Real Hungarian food is peasant cuisine — hearty, comforting, sometimes heavy:
- Lots of meat
- Rich sauces
- Starchy sides (potatoes, bread, pasta)
- Preserved/pickled vegetables

Lighter options exist but traditional = substantial.
