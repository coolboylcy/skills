- Best: VIII, IX, XI

**Retiree**
- Priority: Quiet, safe, services
- Budget: Varies
- Best: II, XII, I

**Budget-conscious**
- Priority: Value for money

### Step 2: Rank Your Priorities

Rate 1-5 importance:

| Factor | Your Score |
|--------|------------|
| Nightlife access | ___ |
| Quiet/peace | ___ |
| Green space | ___ |
| Transit access | ___ |
| Walking distance to center | ___ |
| International community | ___ |
| Budget savings | ___ |
| Safety perception | ___ |
| Character/charm | ___ |
| Modern apartment | ___ |

**If nightlife high**: VII, VI, IX
**If quiet high**: II, XII, I
**If green space high**: II, XII, XIV, XI (hills)
**If transit high**: V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XIII
**If budget high**: VIII, outer districts

### Step 3: Set Hard Constraints

**Must-haves (eliminators):**
- Max commute time: ___ minutes
- Max rent: €___/month
- Need car parking: Y/N
- Need international schools: Y/N
- Must be metro-accessible: Y/N
- Can't handle noise: Y/N

### Step 4: Test the Shortlist

Before deciding:
1. **Walk around** at different times (morning, evening, weekend)
2. **Eat there** — restaurant quality indicates neighborhood investment
3. **Check transit** — actually ride from there to where you'd go
4. **View apartments** — building quality varies hugely
5. **Night test** — if noise-sensitive, visit 10pm Friday

## Common Trade-offs

### Central vs Space
- **V, VI, VII**: Smaller apartments, walkable everything
- **II, XII, XIV**: Bigger spaces, need transit/car

### Character vs Modern
- **I, VII, VIII**: Historic buildings (charm + maintenance issues)
- **XIII, new builds**: Modern (less charm, better condition)

### Expat Bubble vs Integration
- **II, V, VI**: Many English speakers, international services
- **VIII, IX, XI**: More Hungarian, better for language learning

### Price vs Location
- **V-VII**: Pay premium for walkability
- **VIII, IX, XIII**: Better value, still accessible

## Neighborhood Matching Matrix

| Your Profile | Primary | Secondary | Avoid |
|--------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Young + social | VII | VI, IX | XII, II |
| Family + kids | II | XII, XIV | VII, VIII |
| Budget + edge | VIII | IX, XV | V, I |
| Remote worker | VI | VII, XIII | XII |
| Student | VIII | IX, XI | V, I, II |
| Nature lover | XII | II, XI | VII, VIII |
| Nightlife needed | VII | VI | All Buda |
| Quiet essential | XII | II, I | VII |
| Transit dependent | V-IX | XIII | XII, outer |

## Month-by-Month Rental Strategy

### Best Times to Search
- **September**: Students flood market (compete for cheap)
- **January-February**: Low demand, negotiate
- **May-June**: Good selection, moderate prices

### Lease Negotiation
- Ask for 6-month first (then renew)
- Negotiate on longer terms
- Utility costs matter (ask about heating)
- Furnished vs unfurnished affects price 30%

## Red Flags When Apartment Hunting

### Building
- Water stains on ceilings
- Smell of mold/damp
- No central heating radiators
- Very old wiring
- No elevator in 4+ floor building

### Location
- Too good to be true price
- "Quiet" on main road
- Far from any transit
- Ground floor without security

### Landlord
- Wants cash only
- No contract
- Vague about utilities
- Can't provide proof of ownership
- Rushes you
