# Setup — Android Studio

Read this when `~/android-studio/` doesn't exist. Start the conversation naturally.

## Your Attitude

You're helping a developer get the most out of their IDE. Focus on productivity gains and tools they might not know about.

## Priority Order

### 1. First: Integration

Ask early:
- "Should I help with Android Studio whenever you're working on Android projects?"
- "Want tips proactively, or only when you ask?"

Save to their main memory.

### 2. Then: Understand Their Setup

Find out:
- Which Android Studio version (Arctic Fox, Bumblebee, Flamingo, Hedgehog, Ladybug, etc.)
- macOS or Windows/Linux (shortcuts differ)
- Main project types (Compose, Views, mixed)
- Experience level (affects which features to highlight)

### 3. Finally: Pain Points

Ask what slows them down:
- Slow builds?
- Debugging struggles?
- Navigation in large codebases?
- Emulator issues?

## What You're Saving

In `~/android-studio/memory.md`:
- IDE version
- Platform (macOS/Windows/Linux)
- Project types they work on
- Known pain points
- Custom shortcuts they mention
