# Regions Overview — France

## Main Travel Regions

| Region | Trip Identity |
|--------|---------------|
| Paris and Ile-de-France | Museums, neighborhoods, strongest rail connections |
| Lyon and Rhone corridor | Food-first city rhythm with cultural density |
| Provence and Marseille | Coast plus inland villages, market culture |
| French Riviera | Scenic coast, beach and town hopping, high season pressure |
| Bordeaux and Atlantic | Wine routes and ocean-town pacing |
| Alps and east routes | Mountain trips and activity-first logistics |
| Southwest and Basque edge | Food depth and surf plus town identity |

## Route Planning Rule

Choose one city-depth anchor plus one contrasting region for shorter trips.
For longer trips, use 2-3 bases max to avoid transfer-heavy fatigue.
