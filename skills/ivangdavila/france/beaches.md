# Beaches and Coastal Stops — France

## Mediterranean Side

- **Nice and Villefranche-sur-Mer:** convenient city-plus-beach flow
- **Antibes and Juan-les-Pins:** mixed beach and town rhythm
- **Cassis and nearby coves:** scenic south-coast options with planning needs

## Atlantic Side

- **Biarritz and Basque coast:** surf-forward with strong food overlap
- **Arcachon and nearby dunes:** family-friendly and scenic day routes
- **La Rochelle area:** slower coastal rhythm and easier pacing

## Island and Other Coast Options

- Corsica delivers strong coast and mountain contrast with higher logistics complexity.
- Brittany beaches are scenic and weather-variable, great in shoulder windows.

## Practical Notes

- Peak summer beach logistics can dominate the day if unplanned.
- Water and wind conditions vary significantly by coast.
- Parking and rail schedules should be checked before departure.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Planning beach-only days with no weather backup.
2. Underestimating midday heat in Mediterranean summer.
3. Making long detours for one short stop without route efficiency.
