# Accommodation Guide — France

## Booking Strategy

1. Use fewer bases and stay 2+ nights where possible.
2. Choose neighborhood fit before chasing lowest rate.
3. Book key summer and holiday windows earlier than expected.

## Paris

- **Best convenience:** Marais, Saint-Germain, Opera-connected zones
- **Best value compromise:** Canal and northeast neighborhoods with good metro links
- **Watch:** Premium pricing near top landmarks with mixed quality return

## Lyon

- **Best convenience:** Presqu'ile and well-connected central districts
- **Better vibe/value mix:** Croix-Rousse-adjacent areas

## Marseille and Provence

- **Marseille:** practical transport base with varied neighborhoods
- **Aix/Avignon:** calmer pace and better inland route staging

## French Riviera

- **Nice:** strongest all-around base for mixed budgets
- **Cannes:** polished but often pricier
- **Antibes area:** often better value balance in peak season
