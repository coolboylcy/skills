# France with Kids

## Good Family Bases

| Base | Why it works |
|------|--------------|
| Paris | Large mix of museums, parks, and easy transit |
| Lyon | Compact center and strong food flexibility |
| Nice area | Beach plus walkable town options |
| Provence city bases | Balanced pace for culture and day routes |

## Family Planning Rules

- Keep transfer legs shorter than map intuition suggests.
- Plan one anchor activity per day plus downtime.
- Build weather and heat backups into every day.

## Age-Based Tips

### Younger kids
- Short activities, shaded breaks, and predictable meal windows

### Older kids
- Mix museums, coast, and one active element daily

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overbooking transfer-heavy days.
2. Ignoring heat and hydration planning.
3. Choosing stays too far from daily activity clusters.
