# Hiking Guide — France

## Core Rule

Pick hikes by weather, elevation, and realistic fitness, not only photos.

## Strong Areas

### Alps
- Chamonix and nearby routes offer high reward with weather volatility.

### Pyrenees
- Strong scenic routes with varied difficulty and seasonal windows.

### Provence and Calanques
- Coastal and limestone routes are popular but heat-sensitive.

## Safety Basics

- Start early in heat-prone months.
- Carry water, layers, and offline maps.
- Respect closures, fire-risk restrictions, and weather alerts.
- Turn back when visibility or footing conditions degrade.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Casual shoes on rocky or exposed routes.
2. Ignoring heat and sun exposure.
3. Starting too late for longer hikes.
4. Treating all route-time signs as universal.
