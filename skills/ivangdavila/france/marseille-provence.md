# Marseille and Provence Complete Guide

## Core Reality

Marseille and inland Provence need pace planning. Distances are manageable, but summer heat and midday crowds can reduce day quality fast.

## Base Strategy

### Marseille
- Best for coast access, urban culture, and transport links.
- Works well for food plus harbor plus one nearby day route.

### Aix-en-Provence
- Better for polished town rhythm and market days.
- Good for slower Provence-focused stays.

### Avignon or Arles
- Better for heritage and inland loops.
- Useful for village and wine-route combinations.

## Route Rules

- Choose one coastal day plus one inland day, not everything in one push.
- Start outdoor plans early in hot months.
- Keep one flexible slot for weather and transport changes.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Doing Marseille, Calanques, and multiple inland towns in one day.
2. Ignoring heat and hydration on exposed routes.
3. Driving narrow village roads at city-speed expectations.
4. Staying only in one tourist-heavy strip without local alternatives.
