# French Riviera Complete Guide

## Core Reality

The Riviera is beautiful but highly seasonal. Nice, Cannes, Antibes, and Monaco each have different cost, crowd, and nightlife profiles.

## Base Strategy

### Nice
- Best balance for transport, beach access, and city dining.
- Strong base for rail day trips along the coast.

### Cannes
- Polished atmosphere, festival reputation, higher spend profile.
- Better for luxury-oriented stays.

### Antibes and Juan-les-Pins
- Better value and calmer rhythm than peak Cannes windows.
- Good mixed beach and town pacing.

### Menton and east coast edge
- Slower pace and scenic value for lower-intensity route plans.

## Route Rules

- Use rail for many coast-town hops when possible.
- Keep fewer bases and avoid nightly hotel swaps.
- Book key beach clubs and dinner slots early in summer.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Treating all Riviera towns as identical in budget and vibe.
2. Overstacking beach, museums, and nightlife in one hot day.
3. Driving and parking in peak summer cores without backup plan.
4. Booking late in high season and expecting stable pricing.
