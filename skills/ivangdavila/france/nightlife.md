# Nightlife Guide — France

## Paris

### Best zones
- **Canal/Oberkampf side:** better value bar density and varied crowd
- **Marais pockets:** polished cocktail and late dinner options
- **Pigalle/South Pigalle:** mixed music and bar scene

## Lyon

### Best zones
- Presqu'ile and slopes near Croix-Rousse for bar-hopping rhythm
- Better pacing than larger-city spread for one-night plans

## Marseille and Riviera

### Best zones
- Marseille harbor and central pockets for mixed bar routes
- Nice old town and nearby zones for coast-nightlife balance

## Practical Notes

- Peak Fri/Sat windows can produce long queues.
- Reservations matter in higher-demand cocktail bars.
- Late-night transport should be planned before final venue.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Assuming every famous strip equals best quality.
2. Staying only in high-tourist nightlife rows.
3. Starting too late with no reservation strategy.
