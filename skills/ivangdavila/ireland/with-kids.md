# Ireland with Kids

## Good Family Bases

| Base | Why it works |
|------|--------------|
| Dublin | Big mix of indoor options + parks |
| Galway | Compact and walkable with easy day trips |
| Cork | Balanced city + coast options |
| Kerry area | Scenic family road days when paced correctly |

## Family Planning Rules

- Keep transfer legs shorter than map intuition suggests.
- Plan one anchor activity per day plus flexible downtime.
- Always carry indoor fallback options for weather shifts.

## Age-Based Tips

### Younger kids
- Short walks, interactive attractions, easy meal windows

### Older kids
- Castle/history + coastal stops + one active element daily

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overbooking long scenic drives back-to-back.
2. Ignoring weather backup plans.
3. Booking accommodation too far from daily activity zones.
