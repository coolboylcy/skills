## Cork Strategy

- Use Cork as 2-3 night base for city + coast split.
- Do not overfill with too many long same-day loops.
- Weekends can book out early in peak season.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Treating Cork only as a pass-through stop.
2. Overcommitting to long drives after late nights.
3. Expecting every small-town restaurant to take walk-ins in summer.
