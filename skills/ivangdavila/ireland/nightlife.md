# Nightlife Guide — Ireland

## Dublin

### Best zones
- **Smithfield / Stoneybatter edges:** better value with strong pub atmosphere
- **South city pockets:** diverse bars and late dining
- **Temple Bar:** one-pass experience, then move elsewhere for better value

## Galway

### Best zones
- Latin Quarter for energy
- Side-street pubs for better session quality and less crowd pressure

## Cork

### Best zones
- Compact city core pub circuit
- Better pacing for bar-hopping than large-city spread

## Practical Notes

- Live traditional sessions vary by day and venue.
- Peak Friday/Saturday hours can create heavy queue windows.
- Late-night transport plans should be set before final venue.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Assuming every famous pub means best music quality.
2. Staying only in highest-tourist nightlife strips.
3. Starting too late without reservation or queue tolerance.
