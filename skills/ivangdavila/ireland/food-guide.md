## Practical Dining Rules

- Reserve popular dinner spots in advance on weekends.
- Lunch menus can offer better value than dinner.
- In visitor-heavy streets, one or two blocks away often improves quality-price ratio.
- Tipping expectations are lighter than US norms, but good service is usually acknowledged.

## Food Traps to Avoid

1. Repeating only tourist-core pub meals for multiple days.
2. Ignoring reservation patterns in peak weekends.
3. Assuming every famous pub also serves excellent food.
4. Choosing high-queue spots with no menu-quality signal.
