# Wine, Whiskey, and Tastings — Ireland

## What Matters in Ireland

Ireland is not a major wine-producing destination, so the best value is in strong wine bars, curated pairings, and distillery experiences rather than vineyard touring.

## Wine-Focused City Stops

### Dublin
- Strong concentration of wine bars and modern restaurants with good pairing programs.

### Cork
- Good overlap between seafood and white-wine-friendly menus.

### Galway
- Smaller but solid wine options near core dining zones.

## Whiskey Experiences

- Distillery visits are often the highest-value beverage experience in Ireland.
- Book timed tours early in peak months.
- Pair distillery visits with neighborhood food plans to avoid rushed schedules.

## Planning Tips

- Do not overbook tastings on driving days.
- If combining pubs and tastings, decide in advance who is not driving.
- Compare standard vs premium tasting tiers before booking.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Expecting wine-region style routes similar to continental Europe.
2. Booking back-to-back tastings with no meal buffer.
3. Driving after multi-stop beverage-heavy itineraries.
