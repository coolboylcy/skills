# Regions Overview — Ireland

## Main Travel Regions

| Region | Trip Identity |
|--------|---------------|
| Dublin region | Culture density, museums, nightlife, easy short breaks |
| Cork and south coast | Food-led towns, harbor stops, slower scenic rhythm |
| Galway and west | Music culture, compact city, Atlantic access |
| Kerry and peninsulas | Signature scenic drives and coastal viewpoints |
| Ancient East corridor | Heritage sites and castle-heavy itineraries |
| Hidden Heartlands style routes | Inland lakes and lower-crowd alternatives |

## Route Planning Rule

Choose one city base plus one coastal region for shorter trips.
For longer trips, use 2-3 bases max to avoid transfer-heavy fatigue.
