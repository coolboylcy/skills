# Transport Guide — Ireland

## In Cities

- Dublin: LUAS + bus + rail links cover most visitor routes.
- Cork and Galway: walkability + local bus networks work for short stays.

## Intercity

### Train and Coach
- Good for main-city links, less stress than driving for many routes.
- Book key legs early on peak weekends.

### Car Rental
- Best for coastal routes and county-level exploration.
- Left-side driving and narrower roads require realistic pacing.

## Payment and Tools

- TFI tools and journey planners improve day-to-day routing.
- Use live-departure apps for current disruptions.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Overestimating daily mileage possible on scenic roads.
2. Booking tight transfer windows before fixed tours.
3. Assuming city-center parking will be easy and cheap.
