# Wild Atlantic Way Complete Guide

## Core Reality

This route is about controlled pacing, not maximum mileage. The coastline is spectacular, but rural road speeds and weather shifts make over-ambition expensive and exhausting.

## Recommended Segments (not whole route in one short trip)

### Segment A: Clare + Burren base
- Cliffs and limestone landscapes
- Strong short-hike options
- Good for first-time west-coast introduction

### Segment B: Galway to Mayo windows
- Connemara scenery, varied village stops
- Flexible loop potential with weather-based alternates

### Segment C: Kerry loop focus
- Ring of Kerry style routes
- Highly scenic, high seasonal demand

## Practical Drive Rules

- Build realistic average speed assumptions on coastal roads.
- Start earlier than city habits suggest.
- Keep fuel, food, and weather checks proactive.
- Never stack multiple long scenic loops in one day.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Attempting the full route with too few nights.
2. Ignoring weather and visibility conditions before long drives.
3. Booking no-flex overnights during volatile shoulder weather.
4. Arriving to major viewpoints only at peak midday windows.
