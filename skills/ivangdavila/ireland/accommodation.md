# Accommodation Guide — Ireland

## Booking Strategy

1. Use fewer bases and 2+ nights where possible.
2. Prioritize walkability in cities.
3. In coastal counties, book earlier than you think for peak months.

## Dublin

- **Best convenience:** South city core and tram-connected zones
- **Best value compromise:** The Liberties, Smithfield-adjacent areas
- **Watch:** Tourist-core pricing inflation on weekends

## Cork

- **Best convenience:** City center for short stays
- **Scenic add-on:** Kinsale overnight for food + harbor vibe

## Galway

- **Best convenience:** Near Eyre Square transit access
- **Better vibe/value mix:** West End

## Coast and Road-Trip Stays

- Split nights by realistic drive segments, not map-line distance.
- Favor cancel-flex terms in shoulder months.
