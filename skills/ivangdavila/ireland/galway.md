## Galway as Base

- Great launch point for Connemara and Aran-linked plans.
- Better for 2-3 nights than one rushed evening stop.
- Music sessions vary by night, check current listings.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Staying only in the busiest core blocks.
2. Assuming live sessions happen identically every night.
3. Overplanning day trips with zero weather fallback.
