# Beaches and Coastal Stops — Ireland

## West Coast Highlights

- **Salthill (Galway):** easy city-beach rhythm and promenade walks
- **Inch Beach (Kerry):** dramatic setting, weather-sensitive stop
- **Dog's Bay area (Galway region):** scenic and photogenic in clear windows

## South and East Options

- **Cork coast options:** strong village + shoreline combinations
- **Wexford and Waterford stretches:** good family-friendly coastal pacing

## Practical Notes

- Water temperature is usually cooler than many visitors expect.
- Wind and visibility can change quickly.
- Parking pressure spikes on sunny weekends and holiday periods.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Planning a beach-only day with no weather backup.
2. Underestimating wind chill near cliffs and exposed coasts.
3. Driving long detours for one short stop without route efficiency.
