## North Shore Transit Reality

### SeaBus
- **Frequency**: Every 10-15 min
- **Duration**: 12 min to Waterfront
- **Cost**: Same as bus (1 zone from Waterfront)
- **Experience**: Scenic, reliable, pleasant

### Buses
- **Frequency**: Varies widely
- **Main routes**: 239 (Park Royal), 240 (Deep Cove), 228 (Lynn Valley)
- **Reality**: Need to plan around schedules outside peak areas

### Cycling
- **SeaBus allows bikes**
- **Bike routes**: Improving but hilly
- **Mountain biking**: World-class (but that's recreation, not commuting)

### Driving
- **Lions Gate Bridge**: Bottleneck. Avoid 8-9am, 5-6pm.
- **Second Narrows (Ironworkers Memorial)**: Less congested alternative
- **Parking**: Easier than Downtown Vancouver
