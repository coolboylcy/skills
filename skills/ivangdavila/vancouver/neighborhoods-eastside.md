## East Van Generally

### Stigma vs Reality
"East Van" historically had reputation as rough, working-class. Reality now:
- **Diverse**: Chinese, Vietnamese, Italian, Filipino, Indian communities
- **Gentrifying**: Artists arrived, prices following
- **Value**: Still better prices than West Side
- **Character**: More interesting than sterile new condos

### The Cross
The "East Van Cross" ✠ is neighborhood symbol. Seen on murals, tattoos, merchandise. Origins debated but represents East Van pride.

### General Advice
- Don't dismiss based on old reputation
- Visit before deciding (varies block by block)
- Best value + character combination in Vancouver
- Public transit generally good
- Less pretentious than West Side
