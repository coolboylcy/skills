# Memory Template — Inspiration

This skill is stateless by default. It provides references on demand without requiring persistent storage.

## Optional: Tracking Preferences

If you want to remember user preferences across sessions, you can optionally create `~/inspiration/preferences.md`:

```markdown
# Inspiration Preferences

## Platform Focus
<!-- web, mobile, both -->

## Style Preferences
<!-- minimal, bold, playful, etc. -->

## Favorite Sources
<!-- Sources they've found most useful -->

## Notes
<!-- Any other relevant context -->

---
*Updated: YYYY-MM-DD*
```

This is entirely optional. The skill works without any persistent storage.
