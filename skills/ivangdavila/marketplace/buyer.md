# Buyer Guide

## Price Comparison Traps

- **Amazon "Subscribe & Save"** — displayed price assumes subscription; one-time is higher
- **Lightning deals** — "original price" often inflated to fake discount
- **Shipping cost hiding** — $20 + $15 shipping vs $30 free shipping = same
- **Model number shell games** — same name, different model = worse specs at discount retailers

## Platform-Specific Dynamics

| Platform | Key Insight |
|----------|-------------|
| eBay | "Best Offer" at $100 usually means seller expects $70-80 |
| FB Marketplace | No response in 24h = item probably gone |
| Craigslist | Anyone asking to ship or use Venmo = scam |
| Poshmark | 20% fee means sellers price high; always offer less |
| Mercari | Seller-paid shipping sometimes worse than buyer-paid |
| Amazon | "Sold by" vs "Shipped by" = different return policies |

## Scam Detection

**Red flags on local marketplaces:**
- Stock photos instead of actual item photos
- Price too good to be true
- Seller wants to communicate off-platform
- "My shipper will pick it up"
- Payment via Venmo/Zelle/wire (no protection)

**Red flags on major platforms:**
- New seller account with high-value items
- Reviews that mention receiving product for free
- "Compatible with X" ≠ actual X product

## Negotiation Templates

**FB Marketplace/Craigslist opener:**
> "Hi! Is this still available? Would you consider $X? I can pick up today."

**Counter to rejection:**
> "Totally understand. Would $Y work? Happy to meet wherever is convenient."

**"Firm on price" response:**
- FB Marketplace: Often still negotiable, try once
- Craigslist: Usually means firm, don't push

## Authenticity Checks

- Brand electronics: Check serial number format for region
- Sneakers: Box label should match shoe label
- Designer items: Stitching, hardware weight, dust bag quality
- Refurbished tiers: Amazon Renewed ≠ Apple Certified ≠ seller refurb
