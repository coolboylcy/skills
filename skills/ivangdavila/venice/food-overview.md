# Venice Food Overview

## Venetian Cuisine Character

Venice's food reflects its maritime and trading history. Lagoon seafood dominates, but centuries as a trading empire brought spices, flavors, and techniques from the East. The result: unique dishes found nowhere else in Italy.

### Key Characteristics
- **Seafood-centric**: Lagoon fish, crustaceans, mollusks
- **Rice over pasta**: Risotto tradition (rice came through Venice)
- **Sweet-sour flavors**: Arab/Eastern influence (saor)
- **Spices**: Pepper, cinnamon, cloves — trading legacy
- **Vegetables from islands**: Sant'Erasmo (Venice's garden)
- **Simple preparations**: Quality ingredients, not heavy sauces

### Signature Ingredients
| Ingredient | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Sarde (sardines) | Cured, fried, in saor |
| Baccalà (salt cod) | Creamed, fried, spread |
| Moleche (soft-shell crab) | Seasonal (Apr-May, Oct-Nov) |
| Schie (tiny gray shrimp) | Lagoon specialty |
| Polenta | White (not yellow) in Venice |
| Radicchio | Red chicory, bitter, grilled or in risotto |
| Prosecco | Venetian sparkling wine |

## What Makes Venice Different

### Cicchetti Culture
Not found elsewhere in Italy. Venetian tapas:
- Small toasts (crostini) with toppings
- Fried items (polpette, baccalà)
- Seafood (octopus, sardines)
- Vegetables (artichoke hearts)
- Meant to be eaten standing

### Ombra Tradition
"Ombra" literally means "shadow" — wine sellers stood in the campanile's shadow. Now means a small glass of wine:
- House wine, usually local
- €2-3 per glass
- Part of cicchetti ritual

### Spritz Origin
Invented here (Austrian influence):
- **Aperol Spritz**: Orange, sweeter
- **Select Spritz**: Local Venetian bitter (more bitter than Aperol)
- **Campari Spritz**: More bitter, red
- **Standard build**: 3-2-1 (prosecco-bitter-soda)
- **Price**: €3-4 at bacaro, €8-18 at San Marco terrace

### White Polenta
Venice uses white corn polenta, not yellow:
- Served with seafood
- Creamy or grilled
- Don't expect yellow polenta here
