## Character Summaries

### San Marco
The Venice of postcards. Piazza San Marco, Doge's Palace, Bridge of Sighs. Extremely touristy, extremely expensive. Beautiful despite the crowds. Stay here if: it's a once-in-a-lifetime trip and budget isn't a concern.

### Castello
Two personalities: western Castello near San Marco (touristy, grand) and eastern Castello (local, residential, artisan workshops). The eastern part offers authentic Venice at better prices. Via Garibaldi has great local restaurants.

### Dorsoduro
Art museums (Accademia, Guggenheim, Ca' Rezzonico), university students, bohemian galleries. Campo Santa Margherita is the living room — bars, cafés, locals. Zattere waterfront is Venice's best sunset walk. Best balance of access and authenticity.

### San Polo
Home to Rialto Market (fish, produce) and Venice's best bacari (wine bars). The Frari church and Scuola San Rocco are major art destinations. Maze-like streets reward wandering. Slightly less touristy than San Marco despite being central.

### Santa Croce
Often overlooked. Near the train station and Piazzale Roma (bus/car arrival point). Quieter, more residential. Good base for those who want peace and quick airport access. Few major sights, but peaceful evenings.

### Cannaregio
Venice's most residential sestiere. The Jewish Ghetto (world's first) is historically significant. Fondamenta della Misericordia has Venice's best evening scene — locals drinking spritz canalside. Best budget accommodations. Walking to San Marco takes 15-20 minutes.
