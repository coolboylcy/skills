**The quintessential Venetian dish.**

Sweet-sour sardines with onions, pine nuts, and raisins. Arab/Eastern influence from Venice's trading days. Originally preserved fish for long voyages.

### Baccalà Mantecato
**Creamed salt cod — Venice's most loved spread.**

Not to be confused with Rome's baccalà (fried). Venetian version is whipped with olive oil into creamy spread.

**What to expect**:
- Served on crostini or polenta
- Creamy, almost fluffy texture
- Delicate fish flavor
- Olive oil richness

**Quality signs**: Light color, not fishy smell, smooth texture

Cuttlefish cooked in their own ink with rice. Striking black color, briny-sweet flavor.

**What to expect**:

- Stains everything (careful with clothes)
- Sweet cuttlefish pieces
- Creamy risotto texture
- Slightly briny flavor

**Quality signs**: True nero color (not gray), al dente rice, creamy not gluey

### Fegato alla Veneziana
**Calf liver with onions — Venetian comfort food.**

Thinly sliced liver sautéed with slow-cooked sweet onions. Converted many liver-haters.

- Sweet-savory balance
- Served with polenta

**Quality signs**: Pink interior (not overcooked), onions fully sweet

### Moleche
**Soft-shell crab — seasonal treasure.**

Crabs caught mid-molt when shell is soft. Venice's most prized seasonal ingredient.

**Season**: April-May, October-November only

**What to expect**:

### Bigoli in Salsa
**Thick spaghetti with anchovy-onion sauce.**

Bigoli is fat, rough-textured pasta (originally made with duck egg). Sauce is slow-cooked onions and anchovies.

**What to expect**:
- Thick, chewy noodles

- Satisfying, not heavy

**Quality signs**: Handmade bigoli, fully dissolved anchovies

**Where to find**: Traditional osterias and trattorias

**Price**: €12-18

### Risi e Bisi
**Rice and peas — spring celebration.**

Somewhere between risotto and soup. Traditionally made with first spring peas.
