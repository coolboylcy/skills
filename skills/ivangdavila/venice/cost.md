# Venice Cost Guide

## Overview

Venice is expensive. One of Europe's priciest cities. But costs are predictable and manageable with strategy.

### Why Expensive
- Island city (everything shipped in by boat)
- Tourism economy (demand-driven pricing)
- Limited space (scarcity premium)
- Preservation costs (maintaining sinking city)
