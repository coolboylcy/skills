## Accommodation Strategy by Neighborhood

### San Marco
- Book 3+ months ahead (high season)
- Expect small rooms
- "Canal view" = €100+/night extra
- Breakfast often basic

### Dorsoduro
- Book 2-3 months ahead
- Better room quality for price
- Apartments good value here
- Near Campo Santa Margherita = night noise

### San Polo
- Limited options — book early
- Great location for food
- Can be noisy (morning markets)
- Boutique hotels best bet

### Santa Croce
- More availability
- Near station = transit noise
- Near Campo San Giacomo = nicer
- Good last-minute deals

### Cannaregio
- Most availability
- Best value in Venice
- Northern areas quietest
- Some great B&Bs

### Castello
- West: Similar to San Marco (expensive)
- East (Via Garibaldi): Best budget in central Venice
- Large sestiere — location varies widely

### Giudecca
- Hostels (Generator) to ultra-luxury (Cipriani)
- Need vaporetto pass
- Factor in boat time to all activities
- Quiet after vaporetto stops running

### Lido
- Only if: budget priority + summer visit
- Much cheaper than Venice
- Factor in vaporetto time and cost
- Not "Venice" experience

## Red Flags When Booking

### In Any Area
- ❌ "5 minutes from San Marco" — Everything is 5-20 min from San Marco
- ❌ "Canal view" without photos — Could be tiny window on small canal
- ❌ "Recently renovated" — Ask when exactly
- ❌ No breakfast under €150 — Unusual for Italy
- ❌ Ground floor — Risk of acqua alta flooding

### Mestre Warning
- ❌ "Venice" but actually Mestre — Check address
- Mestre is mainland — no Venice experience
- Only if: budget absolutely requires OR arriving late by car
- You will feel like you missed Venice
