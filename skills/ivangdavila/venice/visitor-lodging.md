## Booking Strategy

### When to Book
- **Carnevale**: 6-12 months ahead
- **Easter/Summer**: 3-6 months ahead
- **Shoulder season**: 1-2 months ahead
- **Winter (non-holiday)**: 2-4 weeks ahead (deals possible)

### Where to Book
1. **Booking.com**: Best selection, free cancellation options
2. **Hotel direct**: Sometimes 5-10% cheaper, better rooms
3. **Airbnb**: Limited due to Venice regulations, but apartments exist
4. **Hostelworld**: For hostels specifically

### Red Flags
- "5 min from San Marco" — In Venice, everything is 5-20 min from San Marco
- "Canal view" without photos — Might be tiny window onto small canal
- "Recently renovated" without dates — Could be 10 years ago
- No breakfast included under €150 — Unusual for Italy

### Money-Saving Tips
1. **Stay in Cannaregio or eastern Castello** — 30-50% cheaper than San Marco
2. **Book apartment for 4+ nights** — Kitchen saves €30-50/day on food
3. **Consider Giudecca** — Venice experience, island prices
4. **Sunday-Thursday** — Weekends premium (like most cities)
5. **Last minute in winter** — Hotels drop prices to fill rooms

## Luggage Reality

Venice has NO wheeled transport. Your luggage situation:

### From Train Station (Santa Lucia)
- Walk with luggage: Brutal over bridges (steps every 2-3 min)
- Vaporetto with luggage: €8 extra charge for large bags
- Water taxi: €80-100 but door-to-door service
- Porters: €30-50, worth it for heavy bags

### From Airport (Marco Polo)
- Alilaguna boat: €15, 75 min, luggage OK
- Water taxi: €110-130, 30 min, door-to-door
- Bus to Piazzale Roma + walk/vaporetto: Cheapest but most hassle

### Hotel Reality
- Most hotels accept early bag drop
- Most offer pickup assistance (sometimes free, sometimes €20-30)
- **Pro tip**: Ship heavy luggage ahead (Sendmybag, €20-40)

## Accessibility Notes

Venice is challenging for mobility issues:

**Most accessible areas**:
- San Marco to Rialto (relatively flat, some accessible routes marked)
- Giudecca (flat, modern sidewalks)
- Lido (completely flat, car access)

**Accessible hotels** (rare but exist):
- Hilton Molino Stucky (Giudecca) — Modern, full accessibility
- Hotel Papadopoli (near station) — Ground floor rooms
- Starhotels Splendid (San Marco) — Elevator, accessible rooms

**Resources**:
- Venezia Accessibile: Accessible route maps
- Hotel wheelchair access: Ask specifically, "accessible" varies wildly
