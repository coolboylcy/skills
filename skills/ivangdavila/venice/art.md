# Art & Museums — Venice

## The Venetian School

**What makes Venetian art distinct:**

| Characteristic | Venetian Approach | vs Florence |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Color** | Rich, luminous, primary | Line and form first |
| **Light** | Atmospheric, lagoon-influenced | Sculptural, defined |
| **Subject** | Sensual, worldly | Intellectual, religious |
| **Technique** | Oil glazing, canvas | Fresco, panel |
| **Mood** | Warmth, pleasure | Drama, tension |

**Why Venice developed differently:**
- **Humidity** — Fresco doesn't last, oil on canvas does
- **Lagoon light** — Reflections create unique atmospheric effects
- **Wealth** — Merchants wanted luxury, beauty, status
- **Byzantine influence** — Gold, mosaics, Eastern richness
