# checkly playwright

Run full Playwright test suites as Checkly checks.

## Playwright Check Suite

Deploy entire Playwright test suite:

```typescript
// checkly.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: 'E2E Test Suite',
        frequency: 10,
        testCommand: 'npm run test:e2e',
        locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
        tags: ['e2e'],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

## Playwright configuration

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test'

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  fullyParallel: true,
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { browserName: 'chromium' } },
    { name: 'firefox', use: { browserName: 'firefox' } },
    { name: 'webkit', use: { browserName: 'webkit' } },
  ],
})
```

## Multiple projects

```typescript
playwrightChecks: [
  {
    name: 'Chromium Tests',
    testCommand: 'npx playwright test --project=chromium',
    frequency: 5,
  },
  {
    name: 'Cross-Browser Tests',
    testCommand: 'npx playwright test',
    frequency: 30,
  },
]
```
