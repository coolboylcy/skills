# Checkly CLI Skills

Comprehensive Checkly CLI command reference and Monitoring as Code (MaC) workflows.

## Quick start

```bash
# Create new Checkly project
npm create checkly@latest

# Test checks locally
npx checkly test

# Deploy to Checkly cloud
npx checkly deploy
```

## What is Monitoring as Code?

The Checkly CLI provides a TypeScript/JavaScript-native workflow for coding, testing, and deploying synthetic monitoring at scale. Define your monitoring checks as code, test them locally, version control them with Git, and deploy through CI/CD pipelines.

**Key benefits:**
- **Codeable** - Define checks in TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Testable** - Run checks locally before deployment
- **Reviewable** - Code review your monitoring in PRs
- **Native Playwright** - Use standard @playwright/test specs
- **CI/CD Native** - Integrate with your deployment pipeline

## Skill organization

This skill routes to specialized sub-skills by Checkly domain:

**Getting Started:**
- `checkly-auth` - Authentication setup and login
- `checkly-config` - Configuration files (checkly.config.ts) and project structure

**Core Workflows:**
- `checkly-test` - Local testing workflow with npx checkly test
- `checkly-deploy` - Deployment to Checkly cloud
- `checkly-import` - Import existing checks from Checkly to code

**Check Types:**
- `checkly-checks` - API checks, browser checks, multi-step checks
- `checkly-monitors` - Heartbeat, TCP, DNS, URL monitors
- `checkly-groups` - Check groups for organization and shared config

**Advanced:**
- `checkly-constructs` - Constructs system and resource management
- `checkly-playwright` - Playwright test suites and configuration
- `checkly-advanced` - Retry strategies, reporters, environment variables, bundling

## When to use Checkly CLI vs Web UI

**Use Checkly CLI when:**
- Defining monitoring as part of your codebase
- Automating check creation/updates in CI/CD
- Testing checks locally during development
- Version controlling monitoring configuration
- Managing multiple checks efficiently
- Integrating monitoring with application deployments

**Use Web UI when:**
- Exploring Checkly for the first time
- Viewing dashboards and historical results
- Analyzing check failures and incidents
- Managing account-level settings
- Configuring alert channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
- Setting up private locations

## Common workflows

### New project setup

```bash
# Initialize project
npm create checkly@latest
cd my-checkly-project

# Authenticate
npx checkly login

# Test locally
npx checkly test

# Deploy to cloud
npx checkly deploy
```

### Daily development

```bash
# Create new API check
cat > __checks__/api-status.check.ts <<'EOF'
import { ApiCheck, AssertionBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'

new ApiCheck('api-status-check', {
  name: 'API Status Check',
  request: {
    url: 'https://api.example.com/status',
    method: 'GET',
    assertions: [
      AssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200),
      AssertionBuilder.responseTime().lessThan(500),
    ],
  },
})
EOF

# Test locally
npx checkly test

# Deploy when ready
npx checkly deploy
```

### Browser check with Playwright

```bash
# Create browser check
cat > __checks__/homepage.spec.ts <<'EOF'
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('homepage loads', async ({ page }) => {
  const response = await page.goto('https://example.com')
  expect(response?.status()).toBeLessThan(400)
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example/)
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'homepage.jpg' })
})
EOF

# Test with Playwright locally (faster)
npx playwright test __checks__/homepage.spec.ts

# Test via Checkly runtime
npx checkly test __checks__/homepage.spec.ts

# Deploy
npx checkly deploy
```

### Import existing checks

```bash
# Import all checks from Checkly account
npx checkly import plan

# Review generated code
git diff

# Commit imported checks
git add .
git commit -m "Import existing monitoring checks"
```

## Decision Trees

### "What type of check should I create?"

```
What are you monitoring?
├─ REST API / HTTP endpoint
│  ├─ Simple availability → API Check (request + status assertion)
│  ├─ Complex validation → API Check (request + multiple assertions + scripts)
│  └─ Just uptime/ping → URL Monitor (simpler, faster)
│
├─ Web application / User flow
│  ├─ Single page → Browser Check (one .spec.ts file)
│  ├─ Multiple steps → Browser Check or Multi-Step Check
│  └─ Full test suite → Playwright Check Suite (playwright.config.ts)
│
└─ Service health / Infrastructure
   ├─ Periodic heartbeat → Heartbeat Monitor
   ├─ TCP port → TCP Monitor
   ├─ DNS record → DNS Monitor
   └─ Simple HTTP → URL Monitor
```

**Quick reference:**
- **API Check**: HTTP requests with assertions (status, headers, body, response time)
- **Browser Check**: Single Playwright spec file for web testing
- **Multi-Step Check**: Complex browser workflows (legacy, use Browser Check instead)
- **Playwright Check Suite**: Multiple Playwright tests with projects/parallelization
- **Monitors**: Simple health checks without code execution

### "Test locally or deploy?"

```
What stage are you at?
├─ Developing new check
│  ├─ Browser check → npx playwright test (fastest iteration)
│  └─ API check → npx checkly test (includes assertions)
│
├─ Ready to validate
│  └─ npx checkly test (runs in Checkly runtime, catches issues)
│
└─ Ready for production
   └─ npx checkly deploy (schedule checks to run continuously)
```

**Testing hierarchy:**
1. `npx playwright test` - Fastest, local Playwright execution (browser checks only)
2. `npx checkly test` - Validates in Checkly runtime, catches compatibility issues
3. `npx checkly deploy` - Deploys for continuous scheduled monitoring

### "File-based or construct-based checks?"

```
How do you want to define checks?
├─ Auto-discovery (convention over configuration)
│  ├─ Browser checks → *.spec.ts files matching testMatch pattern
│  ├─ Multi-step → *.check.ts files with MultiStepCheck construct
│  └─ API checks → *.check.ts files with ApiCheck construct
│
└─ Explicit definition
   ├─ Programmatic → Construct instances in .check.ts files
   └─ Full control → Playwright Check Suite with playwright.config.ts
```

**Patterns:**
- **Auto-discovery**: Configure `checks.browserChecks.testMatch` in checkly.config.ts
- **Explicit constructs**: Import from `checkly/constructs` and instantiate
- **Playwright projects**: Define multiple test suites with different configs

### "Where should configuration go?"

```
What are you configuring?
├─ Project-level (all checks)
│  └─ checkly.config.ts → defaults, locations, frequency, runtime
│
├─ Group-level (related checks)
│  └─ CheckGroup construct → shared settings for subset of checks
│
└─ Check-level (individual)
   └─ Check constructor → override defaults for specific check
```

**Configuration hierarchy** (specific overrides general):
1. Check-level properties (highest priority)
2. CheckGroup properties
3. checkly.config.ts defaults
4. Checkly account defaults (lowest priority)

## Project structure

Typical Checkly CLI project:

```
my-monitoring-project/
├── checkly.config.ts          # Project configuration
├── __checks__/                # Check definitions
│   ├── api.check.ts           # API check construct
│   ├── homepage.spec.ts       # Browser check (auto-discovered)
│   ├── login.spec.ts          # Another browser check
│   └── utils/
│       ├── alert-channels.ts  # Shared alert channel definitions
│       └── helpers.ts         # Shared helper functions
├── playwright.config.ts       # Playwright configuration (optional)
├── package.json
└── node_modules/
    └── checkly/               # CLI package with constructs
```

## Installation methods

### New project (recommended)

```bash
npm create checkly@latest
```

Creates scaffolded project with:
- `checkly.config.ts` with sensible defaults
- Example checks in `__checks__/` directory
- `package.json` with checkly dependency
- `.gitignore` configured

### Existing project

```bash
# Install as dev dependency
npm install --save-dev checkly

# Create configuration file
npx checkly init
```

### Global installation (not recommended)

```bash
npm install -g checkly
checkly test
```

**Note**: Use `npx checkly` instead for project-specific CLI version.
