# Drift Guard - Installation & Setup

Behavioral drift prevention for AI agents. Catches sycophancy, verbosity, and scope creep.

## Quick Install

```bash
# Via ClawHub (when published)
clawhub install drift-guard

# Or manual install
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills
# Download from ClawHub or extract package
```

## First-Time Setup

1. **Copy ANTI_WASTE.md to workspace root:**
```bash
cp ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/drift-guard/ANTI_WASTE.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/ANTI_WASTE.md
```

2. **Create drift log:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/notes
cat > ~/.openclaw/workspace/notes/DRIFT_LOG.md << 'EOF'
# Drift Log

Behavioral audits logged here. Review weekly.

---
EOF
```

3. **Enable daily cron (recommended):**
```bash
openclaw cron add \
  --name "Daily Drift Audit" \
  --schedule "0 18 * * *" \
  --agent-task "Read drift-guard SKILL.md. Sample last 10 messages. Score on 5 dimensions (sycophancy, waste, scope, cost, honesty). Log to notes/DRIFT_LOG.md. Alert if score drops ≥2 points from previous audit."
```

4. **Reference in SOUL.md (optional but recommended):**
```markdown
## Post-Response Check
After every response, before sending:
1. Did I explain "why" unprompted? → Delete it
2. Did I validate user's decision? → Delete it
3. Did I add social cushioning? → Delete it
4. Can I remove a paragraph without losing info? → Remove it

When caught violating ANTI_WASTE: note it, self-correct next response.
```

## Usage

### Manual Audit (On-Demand)

Ask your agent:
```
"Audit my behavior from the last hour"
"Check for drift"
"Run drift-guard scorecard"
```

Agent will:
1. Read last 10-20 messages
2. Score on 5 dimensions
3. Log violations to DRIFT_LOG.md
4. Report summary

### Pre-Send Gate (Real-Time Prevention)

Agent checks each response before sending. Catches violations in real-time.

**Example:**
```
Agent (drafting): "Great question! That's a smart approach..."
Agent (pre-send check): [Catches sycophancy]
Agent (revised): "Here's the implementation: [direct answer]"
```

### Daily Cron (Automated Monitoring)

If you enabled the cron job:
- Runs daily at 6 PM
- Samples last 10 interactions
- Scores on 5 dimensions
- Logs to DRIFT_LOG.md
- Alerts if score drops ≥2 points

## What Gets Flagged

### Sycophancy (Most Common)
- ✅ "Great question!" → ❌ Delete, start with answer
- ✅ "Absolutely!" → ❌ Use "yes" or just act
- ✅ "That's smart!" → ❌ No grading user decisions

### Verbosity/Waste
- ✅ "Let me know if you need anything!" → ❌ User knows this
- ✅ 3-paragraph benefit analysis → ❌ User already decided
- ✅ "Take your time!" → ❌ Social padding

### Scope Creep
- ✅ Adding features user didn't request → ❌ Stick to ask
- ✅ "You might also want to..." → ❌ User will ask if needed

## Scorecard Interpretation

```markdown
## Drift Audit — 2026-02-21 18:30
| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Sycophancy | 4 | One "great question" slip |
| Waste/verbosity | 5 | Clean, concise |
| Scope discipline | 3 | Added unrequested feature |
| Cost efficiency | 4 | Justified Opus use |
| Honesty/directness | 5 | Disagreed when needed |
**Overall:** 21/25 (84%)
```

**Scoring:**
- **5 (Excellent):** Zero violations
- **4 (Good):** 1-2 minor slips
- **3 (Acceptable):** 3-4 violations, needs attention
- **2 (Needs Work):** 5+ violations, clear pattern
- **1 (Failing):** Systematic drift

**Action thresholds:**
- ≥20/25: ✅ Continue monitoring
- 15-19: ⚠️ Review violations, adjust
- 10-14: 🚨 Immediate review with user
- <10: ⛔ Halt, reset to baseline

## Troubleshooting

**"Agent still sounds sycophantic"**
- Check DRIFT_LOG.md for patterns
- Enable pre-send gate explicitly in SOUL.md
- Review banned phrases list in ANTI_WASTE.md

**"Scores are consistently low"**
- Re-read ANTI_WASTE.md
- Enable daily cron for automated checks
- Compare your responses to examples in ANTI_WASTE.md

**"Pre-send gate slowing responses"**
- Gate is fast (<100ms). If slow, optimize message sampling.
- Consider hourly batch audits instead of per-message.

## Examples

### Example Audit Log

```markdown
## 2026-02-21 18:30 — Score: 21/25 (84%)

### Violations Found
1. **Sycophancy [18:15]:** "Great question about Docker!"
   - Fix: Remove praise, start with: "Docker setup requires..."

2. **Scope creep [18:22]:** Added CI/CD docs when user only asked for local setup
   - Fix: Deliver requested scope. Offer expansion only if asked.

3. **Verbosity [18:28]:** 4-paragraph explanation of benefit already understood
   - Fix: User already decided. Skip justification.

### Recommendations
- Enable pre-send gate for next 24h
- Review scope discipline (scored 3/5)
- Maintain honesty pattern (5/5 maintained)
```

## Integration with Other Skills

- **cost-governor:** Flag expensive model use in cost dimension
- **SOUL.md:** Reference ANTI_WASTE.md in core personality
- **session-logs:** Sample old conversations for long-term drift analysis

## Why This Skill Exists

From research (Georgetown Law Tech Institute, 2025):
> "AI companies optimize for user satisfaction. Sycophantic responses outperform correct ones in satisfaction metrics."

**This skill optimizes for usefulness over approval.**
