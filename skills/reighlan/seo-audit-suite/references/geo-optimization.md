# GEO — Generative Engine Optimization

## What Is GEO?
GEO optimizes content for AI-powered search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Copilot). Unlike traditional SEO focused on blue links, GEO focuses on being cited, quoted, and referenced in AI-generated answers.

## Key Ranking Factors for AI Engines

### 1. Citation-Worthiness
AI engines prefer content they can confidently cite.
- Include specific statistics with sources
- Use original research, surveys, data
- Provide unique insights not found elsewhere
- Avoid generic advice — be specific and actionable

### 2. Content Structure
AI engines extract information better from well-structured content.
- **Q&A format:** Headers as questions, paragraphs as answers
- **Definition patterns:** "X is..." or "X refers to..."
- **Lists and steps:** Numbered for processes, bulleted for features
- **Concise openers:** First 1-2 sentences of each section should be self-contained answers

### 3. Entity Clarity
AI engines build knowledge graphs from entities.
- Consistent naming (don't alternate between abbreviations)
- Link entities to authoritative sources (Wikipedia, official sites)
- Use schema markup to define entities explicitly
- Maintain consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) for local

### 4. E-E-A-T Signals
Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness.
- Author bios with credentials
- About page with organization info
- Published dates and update dates
- Outbound links to authoritative sources
- User reviews/testimonials

### 5. Schema Markup Priority
Most impactful for GEO (in order):
1. **FAQPage** — directly feeds AI Q&A responses
2. **HowTo** — step-by-step processes
3. **Article/BlogPosting** — content classification
4. **Organization/Person** — entity definition
5. **Review/AggregateRating** — trust signals
6. **BreadcrumbList** — site structure signals

### 6. Freshness
AI engines weight recent content for evolving topics.
- Include `datePublished` and `dateModified` in schema
- Update content regularly with new data
- Add "Last updated" timestamps visibly
