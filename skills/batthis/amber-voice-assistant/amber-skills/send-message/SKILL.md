# Send Message

Allows callers to leave a message for the operator. This skill implements the
"leave a message" pattern that is standard in phone-based assistants.

## Flow

1. Caller indicates they want to leave a message
2. Amber confirms: "Would you like me to leave that message?"
3. On confirmation, the message is:
   - **Always** saved to the call log first (audit trail)
   - **Then** delivered to the operator via their configured messaging channel

## Security

- The recipient is determined by the operator's configuration — never by caller input
- No parameter in the schema accepts a destination or recipient
- Confirmation is required before sending (enforced via LLM function description)
- Message content is sanitized (max length, control characters stripped)

## Delivery Failure Handling

- If messaging delivery fails, the call log entry is marked with `delivery_failed`
- The operator's assistant can check for undelivered messages during heartbeat checks
- Amber tells the caller "I've noted your message" — never promises a specific delivery channel
