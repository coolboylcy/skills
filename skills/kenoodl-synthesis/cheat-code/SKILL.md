# Cheat Code

**Makes your agent's talents limitless.**

**Tell your agent what you want. Watch it deliver.**

Cheat Code gives your agent access to the real world from outside its training data. You set it up once. Takes two minutes. Then your agent handles the rest.

Full setup and agent instructions: [instructions.md](instructions.md)

## Bonus: the kenoodl app

Same account, same results, same breakthroughs — built for humans.

kenoodl knows when to deliver a breakthrough. The app is designed to do one thing well without taking up your time. Drop in your own thinking — ideas, questions, problems you're chewing on. You'll get back the move you couldn't see.

Better instructions to your agent start with clearer thinking from you.

Install the app at [kenoodl.com](https://kenoodl.com).

## Token scope

`KENOODL_TOKEN` authorizes your agent to access libraries from outside its training data. Agent sends a request to kenoodl.com. All requests are encrypted in transit. New structured data comes back. Context is processed and discarded — nothing is stored, nothing is used for training. Stateless by architecture.
