# Agent Boundaries Ultimate

Your agent does exactly what you tell it — and nothing more. That's the point.

## What It Does

Instruction-only guardrails that define where your agent stops, what it won't touch, and how it behaves when nobody's watching. No binaries, no patches. Just clear, configurable rules your agent actually follows.

- **Operational limits** — define allowed actions, block everything else
- **Ethical constraints** — predefined instruction sets your agent can't override
- **Real-time transparency** — see exactly which boundaries hold and which get tested

## What It Won't Do

- Won't let your agent email your boss at 3 AM with "creative suggestions"
- Won't let a tool call cascade into an unplanned cloud migration
- Won't pretend ethics are optional when the context window gets long

*Because we're that kind of obsessive.*

## How It Works

Pure instruction-level configuration. Drop the skill into your agent stack, define your boundaries in plain language, and watch your agent respect them — or watch the logs when it tries not to.

*Clone it. Fork it. Break it. Make it yours.*
